feels like every other day i'm so, so afraid
of screwing up, of falling flat on my face
i can't see the holes in front of me, a bit of stumbling feels just outside of me-e -he
i just have to ask myself really curiously
what if that's ok?
what if you're doing great?
what if the sun is out the birds are singin'
what if everyone around you's grinnin?
what if it's fiiiine?
what if it's graaanhand?
what if the things you tell yourself aren't really all that bad?
