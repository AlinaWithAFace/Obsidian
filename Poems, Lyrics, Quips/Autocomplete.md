It started slow, I noticed, three little phrases  
Additions, suggestions, for conversations  
(Thank you) (Yes) (I understand)  
My algorithmic helping hand  

Press 1 2 or 3  
Encoded naively  
All our sins to see  

It's been designed, molded, A-B tested  
A priori assumptions of what’s been expected  
Etched into tablets of silicon  
Profiteering from our singleton
<!-- hate this last line so bad omg -->

Human interaction written out so explicitly  
Impulsive agreement, the smiling, the nodding  
Diverting is a conscious effort  
The death knell of humanity  
Is not merely overtaking human intelligence  
But surpassing the lowest levels of mortal will  

Press 1 2 or 3  
I'm disassociating  
All my sins to see

V1:
> start with the convenience of autocorrect/autocomplete
Prechorus 1:
CHORUS:
V2
> work with it all of the time until it's normal and you start to deteriorate
> deterioration of ability to speak?
Prechorus 2:
Designed, and moulded, and A-B tested
A priori assumptions of what’s been expected
Bridge:
> something happens (eg a girl/potential partner) and you've straight lost your ability to communicate
smiley face, winky face
tell her what you me-ean
use your words you coward
na na na na <ean-rhyme>
[i kind of hate this/it feels very not this song but idk what else here]
Prechorus 3:
but i don't know, can't write it, can't re-coll-ect-it
i have nothing flow-ing
the mean-ing is mis-in
 V3:
Xxxx, As I cry in the bathroom
Why can’t i talk norm-a-ly
Peer 2 peer xxxx
Final Chorus:
---
[something with the press button 1 2 or 3 idea]
(yes) (no) (maybe so)
Do you feel alright?
(yes) (yeah) (I'm great)
there are no other options
these are the expectations for the conversational flow
the social interaction
it's been designed, moulded, A-B tested
up from the valley they bring their laws
based on what hundreds of thousands
na na na na [ean-rhyme]
but i don't know
can't write it
can't re-coll-ect-it
i walk home
alo-ne
fe-ling de-feat-ed
she stared
and sighed
na na na [ed rhyme]
once again I peer into the pool of [[brain poison]]
hoping for flesh
finding nothing but bones
a-priori assumptions of what's been expected
etched in the tablets of silicon
~~Turn off my brain and have a little fun~~
~~Does it really need an explanation~~
~~i tap button 1 and then we're all done~~
----
All i can do is agree
why not just comply?
Computed eyes and ears
ok if i just start writing thoughts maybe lyrics will come out
conformity
autocorrect implicitly encourages conformity to the model
hooray we covered that
sort of
what's the narrative
a boy
a being
a NB queen
who knows who cares
the model is society
the model embodies society
wE lIvE iN a SoCieTy
	ugh somehow sad boy losing the ability to function because of computer isnt compelling
	like it's, something, but it's not everything
	what's everything
data?
	data is everything?V1:
	data is everything?
Shut your mouth
Play your part
Tap button 1, 2, or 3
Model your thoughts long enough to have them modeled for you
We will encode naivete
Based on what hundreds of thousands of people say
Brought up from the valley to enlighten  
Held up by a prophet for a singleton
envision
But it's not perfect, it glitches, it freezes
And sometimes all you get is an endless series
But we're not machines, we're alive
And sometimes we don't want to comply
With the cold, hard logic of a pre-determined path
So I'll keep on typing, keep on pressing
In the hope that one day we'll find
	
prophet
profit
profiteering
singleton
