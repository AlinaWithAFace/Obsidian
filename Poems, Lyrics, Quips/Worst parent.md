I don’t meet my expectations
I don’t follow my own plans
Don’t wanna do what ‘you’ want
Don’t wanna do anything again

You never let me ever have any fun
I never let me ever have any fun
I’m my own worst parent
Wanna throw myself into the sun
I never had a rebellious phase
(Those are for the ‘bad kids’, anyways)
went to church went to school did what I was supposed to
Got half a PhD but really who cares bro
