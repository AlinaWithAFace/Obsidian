Sometimes I write phrases. Sometimes I write poems. Sometimes they start to turn into lyrics and/or songs.

I tend to take a [[Lichtenbergianism]] approach to creating work, so here's an incomplete collection of what are basically permanent WIPs.

- [[Fractal Lies]]
- [[About A Non-Linear Poem]]
- [[Would have could have]]
- [[brain poison]]

[[Poems, Lyrics, Quips/Non-Linear Poem]]  
[[Poetry Snippets 1]]  -->

Some pieces of my poems, lyrics, and quips are networked because I think it's fun. If [[networked thought]], [[Atomic Notes, Ideas, Memes]], and other ideas can apply in more utilitarian [[knowledge work]] practices (See [[Knowledge System]]), why not apply them elsewhere in making [[Art]]?

Poems feel like a really atomic form of written art, and I think that's beautiful.
