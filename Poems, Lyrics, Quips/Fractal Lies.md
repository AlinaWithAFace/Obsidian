Sometimes I fall into a deception  
A web full of lies that I've built myself  
Projecting out potential futures  
Rolling the dice on "what if" and "how"  

My vision warps right into a fractal  
Infinite paths to infinite ends  
Pick any trail, watch where it takes you  
Follow the road to see how it bends  

I trace a thought I know leads to nowhere  
Pure fantasy takes over what's real  
But it's some space in which I can wander  
That I can play 'round in to see how to feel  

Sometimes I see you, sometimes I see me  
Together at last, like it's meant to be  
I rehearse through our whole "conversation"  
Avoiding the fact I'm in far too deep
