chorus
I’m the same per-sooon
I’m the same thing I always was
I’m the same persooon
The same fears same thoughts same hopes
I’m the same persoooon
Made my dreams come true well enough
But I’m the same persoooon
I guess that fact somehow feels wrong?

I expected it to be differeeent
Even though everyone insists that it’s not true
I figured my life would start someday
And everything would just feel new
### chorus
But I’m the same persoooon…
