There once was a girl named Tilda McSue. 
She had so many [[Thought]], she didn't know what to do.
"The world's full of so much sadness and pain,"
"If I gouge out my eyes, I won't [[See]] a thing!"










So she lodged them out with a big rusty spoon.










But she still had all these thoughts, she didn't know what to do!

"There's nowhere to go, and nowhere to be,"

"Why have legs?" So she cut off her knees.








Sensing less of [[the world]] and less of herself,

Tilda McSue noticed how she felt:

The [[pounding]] in her chest just wouldn't stop. 

So her tore out her heart and threw it on the ground. 

Devoid of all feeling, purpose, and pain.

Tilda McSue thought about [[her brain]].
