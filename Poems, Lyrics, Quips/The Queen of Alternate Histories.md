The Queen of Alternate Histories
too busy time traveling to know what it means

Spins so many tales and so many scenes
Each time she looks back she steals memories
Her visions of love just burst at the seams
Rewriting the pages of melancholy
Toppling empires with so much as a sneeze
<!--Bridge-->
Rewind, Rewind, Rewind
<!--Droning background bit -->
Verse 1
some people are good at lying to others
but lying to herself
was what she was best at
whispering deep down inside
"i know that I can definitely skip that"
Chorus
Bridge
(Rewind, Rewind, Rewind) (drone-y background bit)
Where do you go when you've seen it all?
Flying through time like it's supposed to mean something
w/e themes etc?
rewriting history
eating history
lying to yourself
lying to others
gaslighting
