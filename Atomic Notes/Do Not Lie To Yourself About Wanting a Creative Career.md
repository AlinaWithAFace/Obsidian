> Lying to yourself about what you want to achieve is a very common hurdle, for people of all ranges of experience in fitness. Some people bury what they really want because they're afraid of being vain, or selfish, or otherwise being judged. This behavior will hinder you in achieving your goals no matter what they are. _Somebody_ can always be found to judge you for what you want, because the world is full of [bucket crabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality) and people suffering from [tall poppy syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_poppy_syndrome). Ignore them. If you don't get clear on what your real goals are, you can't pursue them effectively, and you may end up giving up because you are chasing a goal you don't actually want. It's also important to keep in mind that the best person to determine your goals is **you**, as only you can know or decide what you really want. Be receptive to the advice of experienced people, but don't let others dictate what your end game is or should be.

If you are "half-assing" it by lolly-gagging in your workouts, only tracking your food sometimes, or not going to the gym consistently, you must be able to identify and accept these shortcomings in your effort level and how they will limit your ability to get results. Physical fitness is very much an arena where you will get out what you put in.

This is more broadly applicable to life.

Do not lie to yourself about what you want. You *know* what you want to do. 
Perhaps you're afraid of how you'll be perceived as a person who wants it, because "only vain or selfish people want that thing", or "it's not prestigious enough", or "it's not what your parents wanted", or "it's not what people expect of you".

This is all fear.

The people who really cared about you before will continue to be around. The people who don't care about you may fall to the wayside. You'll attract more people who are moving in the same direction.
