I want to do things that matter to me.




I will fight to get there for my entire life.


Sometimes [[The Olds™]] complain about how [[The Youths™]] want to work on things that "matter" or "make an impact", as if that's supposed to be a bad thing.

[[The Youths™]] have watched [[The Olds™]] work at dull, soul sucking jobs just to *survive* for their entire lives, complaining about it _the entire time_, and then [[The Olds™]] are __shocked__ that [[The Youths™]] aren't keen on doing the same thing?

**What?**

[[The Olds™]],

Why is that surprising????

Why is that shocking????

You're not allowed to be surprised about this. You had the chance to engage your brain and think about it for *YEARS*. No more excuses. [[The Youths™]] have outdone you and outgrown you, and you see it, and now you're mad and scared about it.
 
[[The Youths™]] are exquisitely positioned to see all of the negative [[Forcing Function]]s in society. They are poor. They are eager to learn. They are not entrenched in the [[System]] yet, and are able to see its problems most clearly. [[Socko™ is good]].

Because of this lack of entrenchment, [[The Youths™]] are able to be _really fucking loud about [[The Thing™]]_.

Climate change is one of the biggest issues that [[The Youths™]] are loud about right now but that's simply one of many issues present in our time.

I don't want power for power's sake. But I do think that accruing power is necessary to change the world. I don't *want* to go into politics or public policy if I can help it, particularly because I feel like a lot of the political system itself has MANY negative [[Forcing Function]]s, but at the same time, if none of you bastards are going to do something about all of the garbage in the world, I guess I have to be the one to pick up after you.

And that suuuuckkssssss, because that's a LOT of work. [[I want to be time wealthy]]. [[I want to make excellent art]]. [[I want to think well]]. These are generally not very compatible with political careers!! The positions themselves tend to be very high-impact, but also a bit of a time [[Sink]].

The next best thing then is making myself available to people in these positions as a [[Smart Person™]] that is easliy reached in order to steal ideas from.

If that's you, [[Contact Me]]. You might also benefit from browsing [[The Brainspace™]], just to get a good idea of what exactly I'm currently thinking of and about.
