Meg is a dog. My dog. My beautiful, adorable, amazing little rat baby.

I am obsessed with her.

She is the first real student that I've ever had. I watched her grow up and learn from the moment she walked her furry little body into my life.

And she is so, smart?? Her brain is actually just huge??? She's relatively easy to teach, and *very* eager to learn under the right conditions. She's relatively responsive when given commands, and loves to learn new ones when we turn them into fun new games.

She also makes me desire maximum [[Time wealth]]. See [[The Meg Metric]].
