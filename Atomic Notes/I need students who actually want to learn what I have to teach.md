I’ll be the first to admit it: I’m really needy!!

I need you to pay attention to me!! I don’t like talking to a wall, that blows!! It feels bad, it makes me less excited to actually do *~the teaching~*, and it’s just a less enjoyable experience for everyone involved if the instructor doesn’t care.

I need you to *want* to be here, and to *genuinely want to learn*. I cannot teach people who are not willing to be taught, who are not willing to be wrong sometimes, who aren't open to learning more about the world and themselves. I know this might be a required class you have to take for your piece of paper so you can [strap on your job helmet, and squeeze down into a job cannon, and fire off into job land, where jobs grow on jobbies](https://youtu.be/wbq571QME2Y), but *I need you to want to work with me* here.

In return for your cooperation, I’m gonna try really hard to make this an engaging course for you. [[Learning is really fun]]!! A lot of academia is set up to make learning really boring, which is actually kind of impressive.

It’s not always going to work!! Sometimes there will be hard parts, sometimes I’ll be too fast for you, or too slow. Sometimes my [[Teachersona]] is just grating and isn't working for you. So! You have to tell me if something is off! [[Give me quick feedback about my teaching please]].
