Using food in game design is a relatively underexplored area. One of the only people doing work in this area (that I know about anyway) is [Jenn Sandercock](http://jennsand.com/), with her cookbook about [Edible Games](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jennsandercock/edible-games-cookbook-play-with-your-food.

She has a handful of games that are simultaneously recipes and games unto themselves. Eating and flavor is a part of the unique game-y medium that she's chosen to work in, and most of her games take advantage of that.

Food is a fabulous cultural unifier. Everyone, and I do mean everyone, needs to eat in order to live. Food and cooking is a great unifying force across all of humanity. People from literally anywhere can all cook and eat food together, and take the time to really bond over their bread. If you want to make a truly universal game, you basically can't go wrong with chasing topics in and around food, even if you're not directly making a game about cooking.
