I’m kind of selfish if we’re honest. I’m teaching because it’s a way to force myself to understand this material at an even deeper level, and become better at synthesizing and explaining it to people who don’t know as much as me. Above all I’m interested in mastering the art of game design, and in creating fantastic games for people to play.

Personally, teaching contributes to that vision.
