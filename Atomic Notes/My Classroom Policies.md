[[I need students who actually want to learn what I have to teach]]

[[My iterative grading policy]]

[[In this class, we believe in playing well with others]]

[[Effective Students Work At Their Own Pace]]

[[Wasting time is an intellectual sin]]

[[learning from any and all resources including other students is advisable, but direct copying is not]]

[[My teaching policies come from my student experience]]

[[Give me quick feedback about my teaching please]]
