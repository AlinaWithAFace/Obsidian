Tone matters.

It matters a LOT.

It's a sort of subtle thing that people don't necessarily always think about.

The way in which you say something verbally can have a MASSIVE impact on the way that it's recieved. An example I really like is the comparison between how you might talk to a dog or a child, compared to a peer. When you talk to a baby *your voice goes all high, and you make a sillier smilier face, and maybe you drop in more ohmygodyoursocutes* than you would talking to someone on your level.

There's an excellent bit from The Good Place about this idea:

> `Michael:` Oh. Oh, okay. Ah, I get it. I get it. You want me to admit that I was wrong. You want me to say, "Oh, Chidi, I'm so sorry because I didn't understand human ethics and you do. It made me feel insecure, and I lashed out. And, oh, please help me because I feel so... so lost and vulnerable."
> `Chidi:` Yes. 
> `M:` Oh, Chidi, I am so sorry. I, um... I didn't understand human ethics, and you do. And it made me feel insecure, and I lashed out. And I really need your help because I feel... so lost and vulnerable.

On the other side of this, tone can also be used as a weapon. You might use it to in a helpful way to talk down to children, sometimes literally, they tend to be kinda short. But doing it to people who are your peers or who are supposed to be your peers can feel a bit, infantilizing. This applies to people who are not like you but are at the end of the day, your peers.

**Do not use condescending tones on people who come from different backgrounds or who are differntly abled than you. This tends to make them feel bad.** The one exception is if you have formed a real relationship with them and have formed your own informal social contract stating otherwise, written or verbal.
