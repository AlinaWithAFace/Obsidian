[[Key Idea]]

**[[I]] [[can]]not [[stress]] [[this]] [[enough]]**.

**[[Read]]ing [[mind]]s is [[literally]] im[[possible]]**.

[[Sometime]]s [[being]]s do this *~[[quirky]] lil' [[thing]]~* where they get *~[[all passive agressive]]~* [[because]] they [[refuse]] to [[communicate]] [[their]] [[feeling]]s [[about]] [[something]]. [[And]] [[then]] [[instead]] [[of]] *[[using]] [[humanity]]'s [[hard]]-[[earned]]-[[battle]]-[[scar]]red [[Gift of Languageâ„¢]]*, they do [[silly]] [[thing]]s [[like]] [[knock]] [[plant]]s or [[glass]]es of [[water]] off of [[table]]s as a [[way]] to [[say]] [[that]] "[[you]] [[have]]n't [[fill]]ed [[up]] [[my]] [[food]] [[dish]] [[on]] [[time]]" [[and]] "[[you]] [[really]] [[should]] [[get]] [[on]] [[that]] [[it]]'s [[way]] [[past]] [[dinner]] [[time]] [[thank]] [[you]] [[very]] [[much]]".

Wait, no, that's cats. A-doy.

But the point remains!! You can communicate with more intellectual depth than this! Or at least, you can try!! But no matter what, no one can reach in, grab your brain, and peer into your thoughts without you taking the time to externalzie them. And boy howdy are there many ways to externalize them!!

The reverse is also true. *You cannot read other people's minds*. The only way to *actually* know what they're thinking is to ask, or to consume some communication they've previously outputted that presumably expressed what they're thinking.

If you can read minds, uh, congrats, you're exempt for this lecture, go mind watch while you people watch in New York or something.

But for the rest of us! Reading minds is impossible! You don't know what people are thinking unless you ask directly! Maybe you're missing some of their context. Maybe you're missing some of their knowledge. There's a lot of things that can go wrong in communication because of assumptions that gloss over context, it's arguably the root of all communication issues.

It's also a really overdone trope, Disney movies love this as their third act, a blatant miscommunication before the climax and resolution. I'm a lil sick of it tbh.

People will not be able to receive feedback if you don't actually give it to them. There's a bajillion ways to communicate things, but saying nothing is not one of them (usually, sometimes the silence speaks volumes...) See [[Broaching Disagreements]].
