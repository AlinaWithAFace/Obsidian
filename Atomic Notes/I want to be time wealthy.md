Wealth and what is "valuable" can be somewhat contentious concepts. On a societal level, our most common conception of wealth is currency, money, and sometimes we turn people towards it as if chasing it is the best thing for people to do. People who have a lot of money will often tout its virtue, and people who lack it will often vilify those who do, simply for the sake of them having it.

While these are interesting conversations to be a part of, in terms of [[Doing Your Best Work]] and living a good life generally, money in isolation is not a perfect nor wholly beneficial metric. It crucially cuts out people who are underserved, and undervalued themselves. If your goal in life is to simply make as much money as possible, you'll miss out on the vast amount of other good you can do in the world.

This is the problem with billionares, and people who exclusively chase money in general.

So! Money is right out as a singular guiding way of life.

What else do we have to work with?

The one thing that we can never get back is time. The ability to take your time and spend it literally however you want is pretty much the most valuable single thing anyone could ever ask for. Money fascilitates this by helping people buy time back so that they can spend it on things that they care about.
