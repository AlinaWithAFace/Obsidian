I think a lot about how Universal Basic Income as a public policy might help create a glimmer of [[Time wealth]] for everyone. If we demand of people to live in a capitalist society, the absolute *least* that we can do in order to even the playing field is give them the ability to own their own time. And to *truly* own it right? Own it in such a way that doesn't leave them scrambling to accrue basic resources like housing, food, water, education, and whatever else Maslow was going on about, causing them to be time poor again.
