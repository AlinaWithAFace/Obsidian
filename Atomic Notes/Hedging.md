[[Once upon a time]]
---
My therapist, who we'll refer to as Helen because that was her name, called me the "most evasive person she'd ever known". This isn't actually a direct quote, I'm [[paraphrasing]] something that happened to me roughly 10 years ago.

And you know what Helen? I did it on purpose. It was a deliberate choice, even way back then. I was saying *no actually, I do not want to talk to you about my feelings*. I know my parents paid you to talk to me about my feelings after the divorce, make sure I was okay emotionally, yada yada yada, but I wasn't a [[Interest]]ed in [[Participating]], and I used every linguistic tool, every [[Call]] that I had available at the time to show it.

I also did this to my long suffering parents and various family memebers a lot.

I still do sometimes when I feel like it.

Sorry fam.

:)

Hedging, like anything else, is a tool. It can convey uncertainty. It can convey doubt. It can convey questions that you're seeking to be answered.

Sometimes hedging is what you want.

In scientific writing, where everything is designed to be just-so, very on the nose, very precise and academic, hedging language around the things that you aren't touching on within the piece you're working on can be a good [[Call]] to other academics.

In learning, 100% certainty for the entirety of all time is basically impossible. But 1% certainty is possible, as is 99%. [[Call]]ing this uncertainty is beneficial within scientific contexts, because it helps [[Call]] where the gaps are in human knowledge. It helps point out the boundaries as you find them so that other people can fill them!

The whole point of academic writing and academia as a [[System]] is to get closer to the asmpytote of 100% certainty through clever experimentation and re-experimentation, but we're well aware we'll never actually get there. It's objectively a [[Sink]], but we find that it creates new [[producers]] when given enough [[Capital, Resource]]s.

The flip side of hedging is that people can twist your conveyed uncertainty against you, and it can ultimately weaken the things you're trying to say.

This is why scientists sometimes get a lot of bad rap from the public.

Academics tend use a lot of hedging language in communication, since there's always that 1% possibility for doubt, and it's the way they are trained to [[Call]].

The general public cannot be expected to think and use language like this; your average joe might see a phrase like "scientists are not sure about xyz" and take as a [[Call]] to mean an 80% [[Confidence rating]] when they're actually trying to convey a 95% or an 98%.

They're working within the bounds of statistical uncertainty and the boundaries of human knowledge, while the rest of us are working in the rest of the world.

This is why it's *super important* to [[Know your audience]]. At higher levels of decision making, people can literally affect life or death with their use of uncertainty and hedging in communication.

Miscommunicating your [[Confidence rating]] to someone through poor use of hedging and other linguistical tools can lull them into a false sense of security when they should be freaking out, or the reverse when they're freaking out and should be fine. I can be poor [[Call]]ing, which is ultimately detrimental to [[Communicate]].

Sometimes [[Bad Actorâ„¢]]s will do this on purpose.

They *want* you to be confused, to obfuscate and hijack your decision making, or even to hide the fact that there's a decision being made without your [[Input]] at all.

It suuuuuckksssss. I do not like it.

But if it's a tool in their box, it should be one in yours too.

Do me a favor and use it for something good in the world, yeah?
