When you're making a game, you're not _just_ making the game. You're making something that someone else (read: the player) will interact with. Making a game isn't just about making something that sits there inertly, the game requires a player in order to function. The interaction between the player and the game within the player's mind is the [[Player Experience]].

[[Define the desired player experience]]
