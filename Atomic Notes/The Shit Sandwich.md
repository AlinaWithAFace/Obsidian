The shit sandwich is a classic approach to [[Broaching Disagreements]]:

- Start with something you liked
- Then mention something that could've been better
- Then end with something else you liked

This can help 'soften the blow', particularly for negative feedback, and help avoid triggering [[The Backfire Effect]] in your listeners.
