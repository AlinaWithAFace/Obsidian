I know for myself what [[Curiosity]] [[Feel]]s like, because it has been an underlying [[Thread]] in my entire [[Life]]. [[The Boon]]s in my [[Life]] have managed to [[Induce]] it in me, and I've spent a lot of time [[Thinking]] about why that is.

[[Curiosity]] is [[The Driver]] for [[Learning]].
[[Being]]s who are [[Curious]], or worse, [[Identify]] as [[Curious]] are [[Unstop]]pable.

This tends to create mischief. This tends to create fun!!
