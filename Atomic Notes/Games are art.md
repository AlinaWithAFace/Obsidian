Are games art?  
God what a question.  
People will circle this for years saying so much of little substance it's nauseating.  

Here's a related one:
Is poop art?  
Can it be art?   
Let's look at Breath of the Wild for a second.  
It has this function where you can collect little "korok seeds"  
They're just around the world, you do a little puzzle, get a seed [bada bing bada boom](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SEodHWBzDSU)  
It's cute they're all over the place it's great  
Using them you quickly realize they have diminishing returns  
You use them to upgrade your weapon slots and that's about it  
It costs exponentially more to unlock more slots so they get more and more useless over time
And if you collect all of them, you get a giant, golden 'korok seed'
The joke is that it's poop and you've been collecting poop the entire time
This [[Axiom]] is in a way a fabulous critique of many collectible systems that encourage 100% completion
Against all other activities in the game
The [[Axiom]] mirrors the emotional impact of collecting a ton of collectibles over and over and over again for a diminishing return
It mirrors an experience many other games lean on in these systems
And turns it completely on its head with this playful 'reward' 
So, yeah
poop can be art
games are art
poop in games can be art
[[The mechanic is the message]]
