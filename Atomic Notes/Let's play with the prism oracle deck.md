The [Prism Oracle](https://www.prism-oracle.com/) is a beautiful tool that plays with the idea of pairing different colors to distinct meanings.

Game design is more of a squishy-touchy-feely art than a hard science. In creating a game, we can use [[A pinch of color theory]] to help create a particular emotion in order to support your game's [[Pillars]], and ultimately achieve the desired [[Player Experience]].

The deck is full of colorful and minimalistically illustrated cards, each centered around a given emotion or feeling. They cover a pretty wide spectrum (heh) of emotions.

Pain has a deep red shade to it with minimalistic blood drippings. Peace has a light shade of cream, and the iconic image of a dove with an olive branch. Several of the images are a bit more abstract; Disruptionâ€™s bright fuchsia and geometric communicate the idea of disruption with just ~10 lines.
