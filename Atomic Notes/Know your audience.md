A vital key to effective communication is simply knowing your audience. If you are aware of your audience, their preferences, their norms, you can craft your message to suit their needs even better than you could before.

There are a lot of different audiences you might be creating a document for. You might be making something for a programmer to create a feature, or for the entire team to get a good idea of what the core ideas of the game are, or even to yourself to help define what the feature is. Approaching any piece of writing you plan on sharing with knowledge of who your audience is and what you want them to do with the information in it can help you create focused information.
