I want to make games that matter as much to other people as they have for me. I want to build worlds people can escape to, freely experiment in, and come out having learned something about themselves or the world to take with them into the rest of their lives. I want to make excellent, commercially successful games. I want to master the art and business of making games.

I want to start an organization that produces games ethically and excellently for all parties involved. I want game makers to have creative and financial ownership over their work, and for the financial systems surrounding the work to incentivize benefiting players and creators alike.

I want making games to be as accessible as putting pen to paper is to writing. I know I'll have won when a child is able to create and share their dreams using games as easily as they can now with a crayon or finger paints.

I want to inspire other people to see the world as it could be, not as it is. I want them to see how to get there, and make those dreams they see and create through games into realities.
