Boys,

I love you. 

Some of you in a very literal sense. But!! I need you to know that you are being robbed!! There's an entire world of fashion design and communication through apparel that, for some reason, we have condoned behind the bar of femininity!! Cisgendered men typically don't get to experience nor explore any of it!! You're forced into wearing simple Tshirts and Cargo Shorts and dressing like dads, with not much else deemd 'socially acceptable'.

This is ludicrious! Everyone should have access to interesting fashion!! It is an entire communication medium unto itself, its own entire box of tools you can use, and men are being denied it in favor of wearing flannels and nothing else.
