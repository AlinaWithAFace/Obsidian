Color can convey meaning.

Think about your favorite color. How does it make you feel personally? What ideas do you associate with that color? Do you have any strong memories in your life that involve the color?

You almost certainly have some amount of association with the wide variety of color as just, a person who can see and interact with color in the world. Which isn't everyone!! Some people are [colorblind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness) in different ways and literally see the world very differently than you!! Some people are quite literally blind and can't see color at all!!

I'm personally really fascinated to hear how blind people conceptualize color, because it really highlights the ideas that certain colors have accrued over time.
