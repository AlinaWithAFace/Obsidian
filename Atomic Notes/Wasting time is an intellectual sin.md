If you're a student, do me a favor, and never turn in nothing.

If you're a recruiter or hiring manager, read a bit about me before trying to poach me.

I have a full time job as a game designer at a mega corporation making AAA video games.

I do not have a lot of time nor the emotional tolerance for shenanigans. 

Do not be late to things, be it class, or office hours, or meetings with me. Iâ€™ll try to build in buffer time because of course these things happen, but in general, assume that I am time poor, and act accordingly.

This will mean being really on top of prepping before class. Things like reading stuff on time beforehand so you can ask informed questions that add a bit more to the discussion. It might also mean doing the work on time, and again never turning in nothing. It might mean asking your classmates, or google for help before asking me.
