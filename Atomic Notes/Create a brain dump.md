Given the prompt, just scrawl literally everything that comes to mind about or around it to mind. The faster the better. For me, ideas tend to come pretty easily, so I'll usually just start throwing ideas en mass into a text document or something visual like index cards or a [Mural board](https://www.mural.co/). Sometimes this is more easily done with other people who can help evolve the conversation as it's happening. I feel like it's a good idea to try doing it on your own first to start getting a good idea what you're aiming for, and then start to rope other people into it to further add to and refine it.
