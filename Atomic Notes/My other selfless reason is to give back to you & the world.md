[[Personality by Design]]
I've gotten a lot of things in life. I grew up in a relatively affluent household, with a relatively affluent family, in a relatively affluent country with a relatively affluent background. I also look like this:

Which is a shorter way to say that I'm physically fit and attractive.

I think it's a good idea to give people gifts in order to make the world a little bit better, or better yet empower other people to make the world a bit better.
