No, thanks! :)

If you're interested in seeing code samples, feel free to check out my [Github](https://github.com/AlinaWithAFace), which has over 50 public repositories, or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/alinawithaface/code), which has over 20.

If you're interested in seeing a completed(ish) game, check out [Algo Tutor Bot Boss Battle](https://alinawithaface.itch.io/algotutorbot-boss-battle) on my itch.io page (password is "duck"). I made the entire thing by myself save the music.
