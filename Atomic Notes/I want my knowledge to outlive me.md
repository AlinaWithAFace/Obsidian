I think it would be really cool if sometime in the future, I made a universe, and left enough breadcrumbs for people who are enchanted by that universe to pick up the pieces and expand upon it in excellent ways in my absece.

I think it's a real shame when things like the [Bus Factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) completely derail what would have otherwise been excellent projects. Take RWBY. In part, it's an excellent show because of key contributors to it, which is great!! In other parts, it falls flat, and doesn't truly explore the potential that it sets the stage for. They key loss of a central figure in the story's sudden and unexpected death is tragic, not only for the loss of life, but for the loss of the [[potential]] of that life.
