I've found it helpful to first define the questions you want to answer in a given design doc before going about fulfilling the answers. It tends to turn [[Game Design]] into more of a conversation between yourself, a way to outline the gaps in what the project even is (See [[Pillars are the thesis statements of game design]]) before attempting to fill it with something that might make sense or work well. [[Communication for Game Designers]]

For me, it also ends up being more thought-provoking. Questions can be answered any number of ways. They outline the problem you're trying to solve, and help prime your innate curiosity into solving it.

Some examples are:

Solving these and other design questions then becomes the rest of your design documentation. Maybe they help you define [[Pillars are the thesis statements of game design]], maybe they help you define the [[Player Experience]] you want to make.
