Logical fallacies are simultaneously dangerous, and incredibly useful. Humans are lazy. I know that humans are lazy, because I am one. This has been an example of the [anecdotal logical fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/anecdotal) attempting to prove the prior claim. Thanks for coming, I'll be here all week.

Now, technically, I just did an illogical thing. I took advantage of the [anecdotal falacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/anecdotal) and used it to support my argument. Maybe it worked, maybe you believed me for a second there! Maybe you already thought "aha, yeah, humans ARE lazy" and were SUPER ready to accept my second statement, however illogical it was, as fact. That sort of behavior is a cognitive bias, specfically the [belief bias](https://yourbias.is/belief-bias), another related idea.
