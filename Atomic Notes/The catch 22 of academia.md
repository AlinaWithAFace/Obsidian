I found certain portions of grad school and academia at large to be intellectually constraining. This is literally the opposite of their stated purpose. Educational institutions would like to, in theory, cultivate free thought, foster discussions amongst interdisciplinary areas of study, hold space for deep thinkers to go about the business of deep thinking through research and teaching. But there were parts of my grad school experience that just, didn't really do it for me.

Part of this is inherent to the cultural identity of what An Academic™️ even is. Within academia, certain practices are rewarded to academics, like accruing a great number of citations in very popular and widely read journals. It's theoretically a metric for how far and wide of an impact your ideas have had, but in practice I found it difficult to really approach.

Writing an obscure document in super heavy and technical language that literally only 60 people *tops* will ever read is literally the opposite of a good time to me.

Why in the absolute fuck would I spend *hours* and *hours* and *hours* of my time on research, developing unique, complex ideas, only to ship them off to the ivory tower's paywalled publishing houses where less than 100 overly technical people can pay SOMEONE ELSE WHO DID NOTHING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONTENT TO READ **MY** WORK??!?

Sorry, this shit actually just makes me angry, I'm cool, I swear.

It just doesn't make any goddamned sense!!! I want my ideas to reach as wide of an audience as possible, and perhaps the academic publishing model was great in a pre-internet era, but I found attempting to interface with it to be unreasonably difficult.

Look, I don't want to hop through half a dozen gatekeepers in order to get my ideas out there. I don't want to sit around for months on end through a peer review process that demands I hurry up and wait for someone else who supposedly knows enough about the topic at hand to give an insightful thumbs up about it.

Not to mention the sheer number of onboarding norms that you have to be able to absorb when attempting to interface with academic literature. I literally had to *specifically learn how to read*. I have not had to learn how to read since I was a literal child. You're telling me that the people who are exploring the edge of human knowledge couldn't have come up with a better system than this??? Bah!!!

To be fair, a lot of academic writing practices make a ton of sense in a pre-internet pre-networked thought, pre-information age era. But that is the then. This is the now. This shit needs to get better for people, because right now a lot of it is actively performing a disservice to interested and intellectual beings.

I just want to write down my little thought germs, put them on the internet such that they are easily found, and run along my merry way. I could not possibly give less of a damn about academic clout metrics than I currently do. We are at -300% care right now, that's the level.

And that's not to say that I'm not interested in the academic conversation, I really truly am!! But I don't think if it's best fascilitated through pdfs yeeted into a website.

Anyway, the internet is kind of busted, so, I guess the way that I am choosing to interact with these spaces is through writing with and talking about my knowledge graph. Right now it's in obsidian, and I really hope it stays that way for a while, but being empowered to just take [[Atomic Notes, Ideas, Memes]], ctrl+c ctrl+v a link to them into any arbitrary tweet thread, or discord server, or group chat, has been phenomial. It helps me fascilitate the conversation around a particular pointed idea, which I find to be really valuable. It lets me engage with anyone who has a computer, regardless of their involvement in academic circles directly. Practices like this are the way towards better collaborative thinking in my ever so ~~humble~~ grandiose opinion.

Do whatever you will with all of that information. I hope it made you think. [[Tweet at me about it]].
