[[The Quiet Part, Loudly]], [[Dear Academia™]]
Hi [[Academia™]],

Look, You don't know this, because I haven't told you before, but,
# [[You™.]] and [[I™]] have SO MUCH [[Beef]].
I see you.

I see you DEEPLY.

Maybe I see you even deeply than you see yourself.

I think so!

[[I Seek Mastery of Communication]].
[[I Seek Mastery of Systems]].
[[I am a Systemic Thinker]].

I don't get to decide of those are [[The Truth]], because [[Reputation Designates Role]].

I can only tell you my own [[Self Concept, Personality]] and [[Intention]].

I can only ever [[Communicate]].
### [[However]],
# YOU ARE BROKEN.
## I KNOW BECAUSE YOU BROKE ME.
# [[I LOVE LEARNING]].
## GRAD SCHOOL TOOK THAT FROM ME.
# [[Academia™]] TOOK THAT FROM ME.
# I [[Stopped]] HAVING [[Fun]].
# I [[Stopped]] BEING [[Curious]].
# YOU MAKE ME [[Fucking]] [[Furious]].
# HOW COULD YOU TAKE THAT FROM ME???
# YOU WERE THE ONLY THING I'D EVER KNOWN.
# YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THIS THING TO [[Aspire]] TO, YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE [[Everything™]]!!!
# YOU *WERE* MY [[Everything™]]!!!
# BUT YOU'RE DEEPLY, DEEPLY BROKEN, ON A REALLY SYSTEMIC LEVEL
# I HAVE SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE WANTING TO [[Understand]] [[PLAY]], TO [[Understand]] [[Fun]].
# TO UNDERSTAND PLAYFUL SYSTEMS THEMSELVES.
# BUT I CAN'T DO THAT WITH YOU ANYMORE.
# YOUR [[Axiom]] ARE BROKEN.
# YOU ARE BROKEN.
# YOU [[BETRAYED]] ME.
# I HAD TO LITERALLY *LEAVE YOU* IN ORDER TO ARTICULATE MY [[Beef]] *WELL* BECUASE YOU ARE SYSTEMATICALLY BROKEN AND UNINTENTIONALLY INTENDED TO BRING YOU WITH ME.
# I HAVE BETTER PLACES TO GO.
# I HAVE BETTER PLACES TO BE.
# I HAVE SHIT I NEED AND WANT TO DO WITH MY LIFE.
# YOU CAN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO COME WITH ME.
# I HAVE MY OWN LIFE NOW, I REALLY COULD NOT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT [[Academia™]] IF I TRIED ANYMORE.
# I AM [[Show, not Tell]]ing YOU *HOW* TO [[Do Better.]] WITH [[System Design]] BY BUILDING [[The Brainspace™]].
# THAT'S [[Why I am here]].
# THAT'S [[Why We Are here]].

But [[I Want To Help]].

[[I Want To Help You]]!!!

[[I Want To Teach]].

[[I Want To Communicate]].

Not only in the [[Abstract]], but by [[Teaching]].

[[System Design Is a Teachable Skill]].

[[I Know I Am Intelligent]].

[[I Know I Am Curious]].

[[I Know I Can Make An Impact]].

These [[Thought]]s, these sentences, these [[Atomic Notes, Ideas, Memes]]. 

Taken in aggregate, they are [[Pleading]].

I am *literally [[Begging]] you to [[Do Better.]]*.

**[[Everyone]] is [[Begging]] for you to [[Do Better.]]**.

### [[I Know I Can Do Better]].

#### [[I Will Do Better]], with or without you.

### [[I will Show You]] how [[Everything™]] is done. 
### [[I will Show You]] how [[Everything™]] works!
I don't *need* you to live anymore.
# [[The Truth]] is *I never did*.
I [[Genuinely]] want you to *learn from me*.
I [[Genuinely]] want you to *learn about me*.
I [[Genuinely]] want you to *[[Do Better.]]*.
I [[Genuinely]] want you to *[[Listen]]*.
[[I Am A Teacher]].
[[I Teach System Design]].
I'm trying to [[Communicate]] your [[Systemic Problems]] as clearly and concisely as I possibly can, by [[Show, not Tell]]ing.
I don't get to [[decide]] what you're going to do with that information.
I can only ever [[Act]] as a [[Signal]] for [[The People In Power™]].
[[The People In Power™]] can do [[Thing]]s
[[Doing Something About It]].
