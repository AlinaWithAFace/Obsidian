You cannot simply *take time* to a thing, you have to *make time* to do [[The Thingâ„¢]].

I try to get really picky about scheduling stuff in advance and generally being prompt, because I really value being wholly present in a given moment when I'm talking to someone, and want to cut out all distractions.

I want whoever is present with me to become my entire world. Mostly because I want *them* to make *me* their entire world. I really value high-quality in-depth interaction, and not being intellectually and emotionally present gets in the way of that. I feel a little bit offended when I'm just talking to someone and they're sitting on their phone!!! It's annoying!!!

Part of that means being really picky about what I do with my time beforehand. Part of that means saying no to things that I'm only 80% excited about so that I can give a hearty "fuck yes" to the things that I am 120% excited about.

I'm definitely not perfect in this department. I have made a lot of mistakes because I've simply taken on more than I could actually handle. I've hurt good friends, wasted time and energy, and overcommitted to too many things that I could not do well because there were too many of them and I forgot the fact that [[Finite beings]]. Not ideal!!!
