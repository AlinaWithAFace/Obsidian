I love Andrew Yang's [[idea]]s.

I love a lot of his [[idea]]s from his 2020 campaign around [[public policy]], public [[system]]s, and his [[Ethos]] to chase after creating the most public good via [[Evolve]]ing [[Key Idea]]s and [[System]]s.

However, I believe his implementation of these [[idea]]s was faulty. He hasn't actually won an election yet, sooooooo, that says enough about his ability to interact with [[System]]s, let alone [[design]] them successfully.

He kinda just came out of nowhere.

He didn't take the time to [[Design]] social and intellectual [[Capital, Resource]] in the public policy sector. He didn't start with the end in mind, make [[Allies]], look for opportunities to add [[Reward, Value, Utility]] with people already inside of the [[System]].

He kinda just started [[Posit]]ing his [[Key Idea]] for how to improve [[Society]], but wasn't actually effective at getting any of it done because he tried to [[1 v X]] the *ALL OF THE* [[Democrat™]]s for *the highest political office in one of the most powerful countries in the world without establishing himself*.

He lost the presidency. He lost the mayoral race. He lost my hope.

He's falling down the [[The Well Trod Path]] of creating yet another third political party. This has yet to work in the existing [[American™]] political [[System]]. It's a commendable effort, and I'm on board with the [[Intention]], but I doubt it's going to work here either. It would've been nice if he learned [[The Easy Way™]], but I guess he's gonna learn [[The Hard Way™]].

I share a lot of Andrew's vision. I share his spirit, both in character, and for our country.

But I think I can do better than him.

I want to create a system of doing work in and around the public policy sector. I want to tell people what I can do, then show them what I'm capable of by simply doing it. I want to create buy-in for my work, no matter what it happens to be. I want to make friends and allies who care about working on the same difficult problems as me.

I think right now that looks like being a visible [[Smart Person™]] and making myself available for public policy consultations. If you or someone you know is interested in that, [[Contact Me]].
