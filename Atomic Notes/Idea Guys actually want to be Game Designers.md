Lots of people who aspire to work in games want to be The Idea Guy™️. You know, the guy, who's job it is, to come up with all sorts of fun ideas about the game we're all going to make. But that's not a job!! Not by itself anyway!! The real job is Game Designer.

There's a lot of misconceptions around what [[game design]] even is. [[Game design is difficult to teach]].

This might contribute to why so many aspiring game makers want to be Idea Guys™️. Within every Idea Guy™️ is a genuine desire to do [[game design]], but they might not necessarily be articulating it well, nor do they have the skillset to immediately get paid to learn and perform it on a team.

Fortunately, we can in fact work with a desire to learn! [[I need students who actually want to learn what I have to teach]], see [[Game Design Fundamentals]].
