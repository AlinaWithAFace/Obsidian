[[Atomic Notes, Ideas, Memes]]s are the idea that *ideas themselves* can be broken down into a single, isolated, independant and interdependant documents.

[[Meta]], eh?

[[Inspiration]] from [[Atom]]s.

[[Atomic Notes, Ideas, Memes]]s are standalone *things*, such that they can be applied and interface with other [[Atomic Notes, Ideas, Memes]]s [[Anywhere, Everywhere]] else within a [[Knowledge System]].

Typically, this means asking "Can I use this idea in the context of a sentence"?
Is it concice?
Is the thing I'm trying to say full of [[Clarity, Brevity, Wit]]?

This idea has been really helpful for me personally in just writing out and focusing on ideas one at a time. Writing [[Atomic Notes, Ideas, Memes]]s is a big part of knowledge work, the overall process of collecting and distilling ideas down into small ideas before piecing them together to create larger works like arguments, documents, talks, even books. It's a core skill that everyone who thinks about things should master. [[Logic, Philosophy of Systems]].

The concept is quite old in the form of Verses in the context of [[The Bible]], which are themselves a type of atomic note within the larger whole of the Bible. Part of this might be why people don't like it when you take verses outside of the context of the bible, because you're earasing everything around them that gives them all of their meaning.
