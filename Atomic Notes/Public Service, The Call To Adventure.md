I have a lot of [[What I want]] out of life. You might notice that "going into politics" isn't on the list.

*I do not __want__ to go into public service. But I feel like I HAVE to.*

[[I want to make Playful Systems, Games]]. [[I want to give abundantly]]. [[I want to live in a well-run society]]. Our present [[Society]] has MANY undesired [[Create]]s. These make living in our current [[Society]] difficult if not impossible for a great many people.

[[My deepest dream is to build a game studio]]. [[I want to make Playful Systems, Games]].  Game Studios are the ultimate example of a [[Playful System]]! Game studios themselves are [[playful systems, games]] that then create EVEN MORE [[playful systems, games]].

That's the best!!! I love that!!!

But in order to create art well, in order to play *and play well*, people need to feel safe.

**PEOPLE DO NOT FEEL SAFE RIGHT NOW.**

YOU CAN GO ON ANY SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM AND JUST WATCH AS COMMENT AFTER COMMENT EXPRESSES A DEEP, EXISTENTIAL PAIN.

YOU CAN TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS, NEIGHBORS, ANYONE AROUND YOU, AND ASK THEM WHAT THEY'RE AFRAID OF, AND THE ANSWER IS **EVERYTHING**.

WE ARE ACTING OUT.
WE ARE KILLING CHILDREN.
WE ARE WATCHING THE PLANET BURN AND DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT.

I AM SUFFERING WRITING THIS.
I SUFFER THINKING ABOUT THIS.
I SUFFER THINKING ABOUT THIS **CONSTANTLY**.

WE ARE SUFFERING.
WE ARE SUFFERING TOGETHER.
**IT FUCKING HURTS.**

I can't just sit here and do nothing. I can't chase after the only thing I've ever wanted if the [[System]] surrounding it is broken.
