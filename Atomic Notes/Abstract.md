**Abstraction is one of, if not _the_ single most valuable skill you can master as a [[Knowledge Worker]]**.

Being able to take any single idea and tear it down and tear it apart into smaller ideas, and then going off and applying them elsewhere is superduperuseful _everywhere_ intellectually. It helps you steal ideas in creative problem solving on a general level, it helps your tool box of ideas become flexible. It helps your domain knowledge in one area expand to fill another.

It's why people who are not religious can find and extract value out of religous text. It's why morality can exist without [[Forcing Function]]s.
