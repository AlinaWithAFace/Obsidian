Sometimes, people complain about how human beings have a 'lust' for power.

There's something inside all of us that drives us to find, take, create [[The Thing™]].

A lot of this is really good! It pushes us to innovate! To make things, to shape the world to into our desired [[Create]].

But it tends to get problematic when accumulating too much of [[The Thing™]].

Think about your body and its weight. If you eat more food, if you consume more resources, than your body actually needs in order to function, you will gain weight.

This just happens. It is a fact of all [[system]]s.

Adding a lot of resources to a [[System]] that doesn't have anywhere to put them, that doesn't have sufficient [[Sink]] to process the [[inputs]], results in [[Accumulation in Excess, Greed]].

This is a form of waste. It is inefficient.

[[Efficiency is Desirable]].

We have developed subtle cultural and social cues to attempt to correct for this behavior. We encourage people to tithe. We encourage people to give back.

We encourage people to activate the part of their brain that get a high off of giving back. And it usually works! 

People enjoy being generous! People LOVE giving gifts!! Once they get into giving sometimes people just can't stop giving!! It feels really good to show up and bring to the table *exactly what you are able and want to give*. This is why poverty and modesty is socially virtuous, because it means you're NOT hoarding resources, you're being efficient, and humans LOVE being efficient, individually and on the whole.

We have created sub-[[System]]s to encourage this behavior within [[Society]].

Houses of worship and religions have encouraged tithing for thousands of years. They encourage everyone to [[Give Back]] not only what they can, but what they are willing to and able to. They encourage gifts!

[[Governance, Governing Bodies]] do this too, in the form of tax-based incentives. If taxes are the resources to run a [[Society]] with, it behooves [[Governance, Governing Bodies]] to push for and towards activities that are in its [[society]]'s best interests.

[[Governance, Governing Bodies]] are only *one* piece of a well-run [[Society]]. Ignoring, and losing control of [[Governance, Governing Bodies]] as a [[Society]] is to ignore [[Governance, Governing Bodies]] on a conceptual level.

This is my largest issue with much of [[Republican™]] Rhetoric.
