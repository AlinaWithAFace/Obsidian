Index cards are kind of amazing. I've found them helpful in making outlines for papers, creating rules for board games, and as hacked-together parts for board games.

They can be fantastic in creating atomic and interchangeable rules. The spacial limitation forces you to constrain your idea to the size of a card, forcing an atomic thought or game rule.
