Is making something in a game so boring that it's tedious and no one wants to do it a legitimate sort of [[Game Design]]? What's the intended player experience?

Like, if you really don't want a player to do something, but them having the ability to do it is important, can you just make doing it feel terrible? Maybe that's part of your intended player experience?

Or maybe you want something to feel terrible intentionally, because it's serving the overall experience in a particular way? Maybe a particular scene is *supposed* to feel bad because that's the intended emotional response?

Some games play with this in order to create certain feelings or an emotional arc. Sometimes games will give you a taste of power, only to strip it from you. [[Taking away things from players in games feels bad]]
