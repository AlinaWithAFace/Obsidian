I get caught up a lot in what I "*should*" do.

Things I *should* be, things I *should* care about, things I *should* want. In my Christian upbringing this was referred to as the pull of "the world", which acknowledges the shoulds from the outgroup of non-Christians as negative while ignoring the shoulds from the ingroup altogether, or framing them as "from god".

Moving past these shoulds feels like uncovering a truer self. Who am I, why am I here, what do I want, regardless of the shoulds pulling at my attention in every direction?
