[[Recursion]] is the idea that [[Atom]]s can contain *other [[Atom]]s*. It's a superduperuseful [[Design Pattern]] in [[Programming]], but also an [[Emergent Behavior]] in [[Mother Nature Herself]]. We see this in [[System]]s that build on themselves constantly. The idea of [[Evolutionâ„¢]], the idea of [[Evolve]]ing, of change itself, is built on [[Recursive]]. [[Useful]] [[Atom]]s [[Create]] [[More]] [[Atom]]s.
