Look, I'm sure you have a lot of grand, and wonderful ideas in that big beautiful brain of yours. No matter where you are in your career, you probably have some ideas that feel precious to you somehow, as if they're irrefutable facts and ways of being that are nearly laws of the universe.

Spoiler alert.

They are not laws of the universe.

You, or someone you know or know of, made them up.

Deciding to yourself that some idea that you have is an unkillable child is a recipe for becoming ~~a f---ing nightmare of a person~~ impossible to work with.

Kill your children.

Not literally. We're still talking about your ideas here. [They are not human, and they cannot feel pain.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etJ6RmMPGko) They will beg with you, plead with you not to kill them. But [again, they are not human, they can't die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etJ6RmMPGko).
