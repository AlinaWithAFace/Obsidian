This is such a funny phrase?? I love it???

I heard it from my roommate Francis once upon a time, I think he heard it from some Magic the Gathering YouTuber.

It's a nice lil reminder that sometimes, there's a lot of meaning in language, and all you have to do is take the time to parse it to figure out what's actually going on. The original joke is about Magic The Gathering Cards, but I think you can apply it in all kinds of places. Strange academic terms built with lots of Latin bases? If you know enough latin, which you should because [[Latin Atomizes language]] it becomes a game of Reading the Words Explains the Words.

I guess it could also come across as unhelpful and condescending (especially to nonnative English speakers) depending on the context. But!! I do not care!! Context is dead and we have killed him!! Thanks internet!!
