In [[Game Design]], [[Pillars]] might be described in a similar way to a [[Core Curiosity]], as they frame the key experience to be created for the whole team to rally behind. They're the thesis statement for your game's experience as a whole. They're something for your team to rally behind, to charge into the unknown game with, to expand on while bringing their work back to the core point that's intended to guide the whole.

Pillars act as a guiding light for a specific game. For example, you might want to make a game about a particular experience, a feeling, an activity.

Pillars help answer the question "What game are we making?" 

Sidebar, the devs behind outer wilds used this idea of 'curiosities' in a really direct way to design their game and it's wild oh my god it was just a pillar this entire time
