[[Hell]] is "A Bad Place", in contrast to [[The Good Place]].

The [[Abstract]] of [[Hell]] can mean a great many things.

[[Hell]] is created by broken [[System]]s.

The phrase "We live in hell" from [[Human]]s taking on the role of [[Socko™]]s in public forums is literally the clearest [[Call]] [[The People In Power™]] could ask for.

They are telling you that they are suffering. They are telling you they are being *crushed, often to __death__* under the weight of the [[System]]. The sheer weight of the [[Forcing Function]]s in their lives are overwhelming, and they're literally begging you for *any way out*.

If [[The People In Power™]] do not provide a way out, [[Socko™]] becomes [[The Joker™]].
