I don't like repeating myself.

It's inefficient communication. I find it annoying. It's literally the worst thing about conversations. It's the unfun parts of talking to people, and especially a great many people at once.

Writing things down is a really efficient form of communication. Once a thing is written down, you can constantly point at it and say "Hi, hello, I know [[The Thing™]], you can know that I know [[The Thing™]] because I wrote it down somewhere. Here, look at it."

This underpins a lot of the education system.
