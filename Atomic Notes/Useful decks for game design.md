I quite like playing with cards in my [[Game Design]] practice. Some useful decks include:
1. Blank Index Cards [[Index cards are underrated design tools]]
2. A playing card deck
	- This is a pretty useful tool, I've used it to improvise games a handful of times by scraping together a bunch of decks and picking and choosing which cards to play with. Not to mention the hundreds of traditional games your standard 52 card deck can support.
3. The Prism Oracle Deck [[Let's play with the prism oracle deck]]
4. The Art of Game Design: a Book of Lenses 
	- [Jessie Schell](https://www.schellgames.com/art-of-game-design/)'s deck based on his book
5. Tarot
	- See [Anna Anthropy](https://twitter.com/adult_witch)â€™s work, I believe she has a few games using Tarot on her [itch.io](https://w.itch.io/)
	- [Cat Manning](https://twitter.com/catacalypto) also has a chapter in [Procedural Storytelling in Game Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42479553-procedural-storytelling-in-game-design) about their experience using Tarot as a Procedural Storytelling tool.
