> We work too hard. We try too hard. Don't try. Don't work. It's there. Looking right at us, aching to kick out of the closed womb.

Liking the idea of something vs liking the reality of it are two **very** different things.

I run into this problem a lot. I love the idea of doing *a thing* and then after trying *the thing* it turns out I do not actually like doing *the thing*. It's hard to admit!!! I like the idea of being good at very many things and trying a lot and getting good at different skills, but it's also overwhelming, and I don't like feeling uncomfortable or stupid or bored. Sometimes there's just a distaste for the activity that I can't necessarily put my finger on, but it's still there, it's still present.

I find it's better to release yourself from those things that you realize you don't like, rather than forcing yourself to into a heads-down-death-march into them against your own will, making yourself miserable in the process.

Try the thing, admit you don't actually like it as much as you thought you were going to, and move on to spend your time on better and more important things.
