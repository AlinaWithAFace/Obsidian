Only you are going to know what you're capable of. Other people can make their own best guesses, but you, the person reading this, are in the best position to see yourself in, (if you're honest with yourself anyway).

What do you think that you can do? What do you want to do? What do you want to get better at? What in life excites you? What do you want to add to this crazy and wild ride that we call life? What people do you want to help? In what ways do you want to help? Why do you want to help them in particular? Can you convince them to pay you to help in those particular ways?

You're the best person to answer those questions, and answering them well will help you tune in to what your best work could be and will become.

No one else can tell you this. You have to find it yourself. Other people can try, and boy howdy do they try. You can find all sorts of unsolicied advice about what you 'should' do, who you 'should' become. Some of it may be useful to you, some of it might be trash.
