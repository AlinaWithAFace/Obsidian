Usually, people use this phrase in the face of great distress.

Natural disasters, deaths, great, large scale tragedies.

They're typically not really directing it anywhere in particular, and it's really just a positive sentiment at its core generaly usage.

However, [[I am quirky]].

I think it's funny to use it as a genuine question, like "hi hello I have created this thing please give me your thought and prayers about it".

I'll stop when I feel like it ✌️
