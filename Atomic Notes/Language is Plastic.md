The sooner you realize that the entirety of language and communication is composed of maleable tools for you to use and play with, the better. [[Latin Atomizes language]].

**Langauge is Plastic**.

It has not always been like this. It will certainly be different in the future. Everything within language, and communication generally, is in this [[Evolve]]ing state. Human communication [[Evolve]]s and is itself a sort of [[System]]. We create norms and practices and grammar not because we *have* to, but because they are useful in [[Communicate]]ing to and with [[Human]]s more [[Efficient]].

Take the humble period. 

Yeah.

This guy: `.`

He has not always existed!! Someone had to invent him!! I think it was a monk of some sort in the mid 1400's but I can't be assed to look it up right now so go with me here for a minute!!

People used to just write things down, willy-nilly, without any punctuation. [[Thought]]s simply flowed, rushing together, trailing on one another, in a similar way to [[verbal communication]]. We developed things like punctuation to help communicate other [[Abstract]]s of ideas within verbal communication, like pausing. Periods facilitate this; semicolons fascilitate a different kind of pause, as do commas.

Deeply internalizing the fact that everything in langauge is a tool to be played with will unlock worlds of communication for you. This is a [[Key Idea]]

We see this happen a lot with the internet, where [[The Olds™]] complain about how [[The Youths™]] don't know how to speak anymore and all they're saying is gobbledygook and won't they please get off of my lawn? Tale as old as time, truly. Literally [Socrates himself bullied children for *writing* instead of *debating*](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=3894). This is ludicrous! It's revealing their lack of curiosity, their unwillingness to learn, it's punching down at people for a being [[The Other™]].

So! Invent things! Innovate!! We're already doing this as a society, we might as well do it on purpose!! Create words, smash together phrases, develop and name concepts, don't ask for permission!!

Just do it!!

This is part of art!!

This is part of being a human!!

Personally, I do this A LOT, so I'm mostly speaking from experience here. I do things like adding ™ to the end of specific concepts, or Capitalizing Them as if they're Proper Nouns, in order to emphasize particular aspects about them or even just to subtley point out that they mean a very specific idea. I think it makes me a strong communicator. You'll be better off knowing about this and using it to your advantage.
