I have a bit of a journey with note taking systems

In high school, we were one of the first cohorts that had iPads 
and if that sentence doesn't make you feel ancient nothing will

*Maybe not this word for word but whatever*
*I can guarantee I’m aging myself here*
*Oh tehee you think mentioning you liked Atari games is bad we can get worse*
*There’s a bookie in the back taking bets as to my age submit your best guesses*

So we had ipads, which naturally have access to the app store which has swaths and swaths of note taking apps
And I tried all of them
Or at least a lot of them
I probably tried a half a dozen or so and then landed on good reader
https://www.goodreader.com
Good reader was one of these very early apps, you could not only edit pdfs of textbooks that you very legally squires, draw in the digital margins as it were, but you could also just create text files
Which, wow, fun, wild you just type the text into a note, and that’s it, crazy

Markdown is good

Todoist, roam, gitbook have these lovely little features where they’ll blow up links and grab the heading text and image, it adds so much flavor to notes with data that’s already out there

Todoist was perhaps a low point
I moved from google keep, was annoyed with their lack of markdown support but adored the small implicit package size of the notes so I strapped together its comment system

It was I’ll advised don’t do this if you don’t take anything away from this talk take away the fact that a to do app is not good for hosting your personal knowledge base

So, I have strong opinions about note taking systems
Platform lock is bad 
There are entire manifestos about why word docs are terrible content prisons

This is where we run with a journey metaphor
