When performing knowledge work, sometimes it can be hard to see the gaps and what else needs to change or be improved in a given document. 

Criticism and feedback that's separated from the core document can get lost and left unactioned. After the feedback's been 'processed' (either integrated into the document somehow or acknowledged and thrown away), then it doesn't matter so much, but until that happens, it can be helpful to keep criticism inline with the documents, and ideally noted on the specific individual sections they're referring to.

Google docs is amazing for this. It's super helpful to have a running meta-commentary about the document using things like comment systems. Markdown sort of has this feature built in (see [[How to comment in markdown]]), but the implementation could be better imo. 

In knowledge work, sometimes it can be hard to quite tell where to go next, there's practically an infinite number of directions to take with any given piece of work. It's, quite literally, only limited by your imagination. Any structure or feedback can start to serve as bones for the rest of what you're working on as you're writing and building it up.

This can also help prevent duplicated feedback. Bob might have some feedback that Alice has already given, but if the feedback is stored elsewhere Bob won't know that it's already been brought up and duplicate it again, leading to more work in processing the feedback.

I also find it helpful as a framing method for collaboration, it's "us" vs "the document". Assuming we're all trying to make the document better and are acting in good faith, open conversations and constructive criticism should be happening constantly.
