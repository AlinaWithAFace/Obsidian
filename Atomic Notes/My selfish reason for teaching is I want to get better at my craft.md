I’m kind of selfish if we’re honest. I’m teaching because it’s a way to force myself to understand this material at an even deeper level, and become better at synthesizing and explaining it to people who don’t know as much as me.

Literally the only thing I’ve ever wanted to do with my life is make fantastic games. To me, teaching contributes to that vision. I want to master the craft of game design, because I think games are really important, to not only me, but the world.
