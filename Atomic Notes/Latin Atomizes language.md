Yes, you should learn Latin. No, this isn't a joke. No, no one speaks it. Yes, it's a dead language. But boy howdy you should learn it anyway, at least a little.

Knowing Latin, and [[etymology]] in general, can be *super* useful in understanding and parsing new words. This applies in English in my experience, but I imagine it's also relevant in other Latin-based languages. French, Spanish, and Dutch are all examples of languages with roots in Latin.

It's kinda busted! It turns learning new words into a game of [[Reading the Card Explains the Card]], you can build up your own internal vocabulary of [[Atomic Notes, Ideas, Memes]]s within language itself through roots, suffixes, prefixes. Latin is the basis that many meta patterns modern languages have arisen from, and English tends to mesh them all together to easily learn new ones.

My mom made me take Latin lessons when I was homeschooled, and she was right to in hindsight. We used Latin's Not So Tough CDs. I have no idea if they still exist, I was like 10. It has been a very long time.
