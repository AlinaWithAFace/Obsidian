[[Practicality]].

[[Hedonism]].

I guess I'd describe my general approach to life as Practical Hedonism. I feel like I'm primarily here to have a good time. But not in a naively hedonistic way where it's *all* party *all* of the time. There are simply things in life that are unfun to do, but necessary for life to happen well over an extended period of time.

I don't like doing the dishes, I find it kind of boring and unfun. A naively hedonist approach might take a distaste for dishes and say "Bah! why would I do that?! I do not like it!! It is unfun!! Therefore I will not do that!!"
And then it's 3 days later and the dishes are piling up in the sink and you're out of clean plates and microwaving a hot pocket on a paper towel as the only form of real sustinence you've had in days. Do not ask me how I know this.

Practicle hedonism might look at the pile of dishes and weigh the pros of doing them against cons of not doing them
