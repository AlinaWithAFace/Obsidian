The game I most heavily played growing up with social aspects was Mabinogi, an MMORPG by Nexon. I played it almost religiously from around ages ~11-16 or so. It did a lot of things really well in terms of personal expression social features, I certainly wouldn't have played it nearly as long if I hadn't made friends over it, and turned it into one of my first real social networks outside of reality.

The guild system was one of the foundational pieces that kept groups of friends together in my experience. Some players made guilds, other players could join them, they had a guild-only chat, it was lovely. During my stay, I hopped across a handful of guilds as friends and friendgroups came and went. 

One of the things they did quite well in player onboarding, was the first mission of the first generation of story quests to complete required you to rope in 2 other players. In order to progress really early on, you kind of had to figure out how to make a party of friends or strangers to complete it with. It softly encouraged you to get outside of your antisocial bubble as a new player, and start interacting with the other people in the game.
