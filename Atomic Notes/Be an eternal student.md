Actually?

No.

Fuck that.

Maurice is wrong and so is everyone else who quoted him.

I'll die on this molehill.

We get better by fucking up. We learn by making mistakes, interacting with the world, getting feedback, and integrating it gracefully into our lives. You cannot do that if you remain in a vacuum. You cannot do that if you refuse to be loud, to speak up when you do not understand.

If you want to do really great work, you need to get really comfortable with being wrong, and being wrong A LOT. You need to be able to take feedback well, truly think about it, and bring it into your way of thinking about things.

And that's really hard!! It is uncomfortable!! I know I don't like being uncomfortable, and I can make a guess that neither do you!!

But if you want to get good at something, anything, being wrong needs to become a second nature to you. You must always be primed to learn from your mistakes.
