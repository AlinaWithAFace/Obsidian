[[What]] [[Now]]?
---
[[You™.]] [[Should]] [[Create]] [[Thought Train]]s.

[[How]] [[Do]] [[I™]] [[Create]] [[Thought Train]]s?
---

*Explicitly [[Direct]] [[Your]] [[Intention]] [[Toward]]s:*

1. Saying you're going to do so, to yourself or others.
2. Stepping through every piece of your thinking.
3. [[Externalize]]ing [[You™.]]r [[Thinking]].

This is not only one of the most intrinsically [[Reward, Value, Utility]]able things that you can do for yourself, but also other people.

[[Crucially]], It has nothing to do with your other [[Role]]s in [[The World]].

[[Teaching is a Forcing Function for Learning]].

[[Aspring]] to [[Become]] a [[Teacher]] isn't *just* a [[Utilitarian]] [[Thing]] for you to do for yourself.

[[Inducing]] [[Emergent Behavior]]s is a [[Utilitarian]] [[Action]] for [[Society]] [[At Large]].

Doing this well *is* [[Society]]'s [[Best Work]]

[[Doing]] puts the [[Being]] in [[Human]] [[Being]].

[[Doing]], [[Creating]] [[Thought]] [[Train]]s is a [[Good Thing To Do]]
