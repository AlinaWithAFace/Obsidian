If you're able to enchant someone into listening to you, but aren't able to follow through on your implicit promises of ~whatever the thing you're selling them is supposed to be~, you mislead them.

This applies in many contexts.

Conmen, cultists, religious leaders, marketing done poorly, and so, so, sOOO much of social media, are all affected by this. It's all sales with so little substance. It's setting up listeners for promises that it will *never* be able to keep, especially when the thing they're selling you is an outright lie.

Conversely, [[Intellect without Charisma is Impactless]].
