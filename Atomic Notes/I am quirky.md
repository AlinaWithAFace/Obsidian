What defines "quirkiness"? What *exactly* makes someone "quirky"?

My guess is it's a collection of non-standard behaviors compared to the rest of society. Basically, are you a funny lil guy that fucks around and does weird shit. Do you get into shenanigans or not, if yes, what % of your time is spent in shenanigan land?

It's also just having a unique personality. I guess "quirky" is the more fun and positive way to put it (or can be used as such anyway), but humans like to shit on people who aren't like them, so, there's definitely negative implementations of the "quirky = bad" idea.

I guess my specific implementation of "quirkiness" that's the most visible is my active and deliberate [[futzing with language and words]]. I say a lot of shit in a lot of unique ways that not a lot of other people say, both in terms of the actual content and meaning, and the way I say it. Other my life, I've cultivated a pretty unique voice, as have most people in their own ways I imagine, and I don't really try to hide that because I feel like it would make me kinda miserable.
