Players want an experience that's fun to replay, that they can come back to over and over again without it feeling stale or boring.

To me, replayability means game systems that create if not an entirely new experience, unique and interesting variations. Roguelikes rely on randomness and procedural generation heavily, and I think that tends to give them in particular an edge amongst other less systemic games. A lot of replayable games, particularly competitive ones, rely heavily on other players, since human beings themselves can be hard to predict, and constantly up the ante for each other. A lot of my thoughts on this are heavily based on [Michael Sellers' Advanced Game Design: A Systems Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Game-Design-Systems-Approach/dp/0134667603), it's a fabulous read in this area.
