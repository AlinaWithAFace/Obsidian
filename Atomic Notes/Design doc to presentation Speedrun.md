Live demo, Make a game design doc/wiki and slideshow as fast as possible

rock paper scissors

- start a timer
- write about each of the parts of the game
- eg rock, paper, scissors
- compile the important parts to share with a team
- grab images from the internet for each element
- write about how the elements should interact
- cheat a little using emojis

other speedruns are usually more about the software development piece of games rather than the paper design, or, god forbid, playing the game itself fast, we're really innovating out here

The thing where obsidian and markdown can become slides shows instantly
