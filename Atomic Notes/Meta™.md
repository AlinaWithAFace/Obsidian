[[Meta™]] is a [[Corporation]].
[[Meta™]] is a [[System]].
[[Meta™]] is Facebook.
[[Human]]s *do not like Facebook*

[[Meta™]] is *literally* trying to play the [[Metagame]].

Their entire purpose is to [[Min-max]] [[Capitalism]]. It's right there in the name!!

They *know* they're doing that. *Of course it's on purpose*.

If you look at the [[Products]]s that [[Meta™]] creates and is choosing to be [[Driven]] by, they aren't exactly good. It's *really obvious* that they do not have [[Society]]'s best interests as [[Intention]]s, and that is fucking awful for [[Society]].

The [[System]], the [[Corporation]] that is [[Meta™]] is [[Driven]] by, is harvesting and monetizing [[Attention, Energy]].

[[Human]]s might not always be able to articulate it, but they can *[[feel]] it*, deep in their bones, every time they interact with the [[System]].

[[Meta™]] takes.

[[Meta™]] takes and takes and takes and takes.

[[Meta™]] [[Love]]s to be an [[Infinite Sink]] for [[Attention, Energy]] because it's driven by [[Capitalism]]. They [[Create]]d a [[Unique Position]] in the [[Market]], they're leaning in to [[Capitalizing]] on it *at the expense of [[Society]]*.
