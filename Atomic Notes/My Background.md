Hiya!!

My name is [[About Me/The Credits/Alina Christenbury]]. I'm a game desiger, creative / techy type, academic-ish, and [[human woman]]. My pronouns are she/her.

I went to the [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/) for Computer Science from 2015-2019, then managed to get into their CS PhD program which seemed like a good idea at the time.

In undergrad I started working in VR/AR/XR, building a [North Star headset](https://docs.projectnorthstar.org) over a summer and self-teaching a ton of Unity.

I've worked on a few educational games with professors and for medical/environmental research, and in my senior year gave a TedX Talk (it's on youtube!!). [[Defining the Next Generation of Human-Computer Interaction]]

From there my research moved to AI/ML/deep learning applications for games, where I helped lead a team that worked on a text-to-character project at the [Sensify Lab](https://sensifylab.cis.udel.edu/).

On the side I've worked on a few board games, one of which won a pitch competition in 2020. [[Erupcio]]

I also started the Delaware Games Collective, a sort of meetup/industry group for the state.

As I started grad school I realized a PhD wasn't for me and shifted to a masters, which I graduated from in December 2021.

I've been a gamer basically forever and grew up in a house of ~7 gamer girls, and I also have a beautiful rat dog named Meg who I'm obsessed with!
