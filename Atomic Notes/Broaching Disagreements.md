[[Broach]]ing [[Disagreement]]s
---

Making games with other people sometimes means you need to tell them they're wrong. Or rather, that you disagree with or do not fully grasp the thing they are trying to do, and there's a gap between your perspectives.

Being able to communicate disagreements in ideology, direction, feature implementation, whatever, is crucial to a well-functioning team. *It's also really really hard to do well!!!* I am not that good at it!!! But I will try to tell you what I *do* know.

*Not* communicating disagreements, even for minor things, is ultimately detrimental to the game you're all trying to make. You want your game to succeed, right? So does everyone else on your team, right? If either of these statements is false, you have bigger problems. See [[No one can read minds]].
