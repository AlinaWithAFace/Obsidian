I have a really awesome dog named Meg. She's literally the best. This is an indisputable fact, and no, I will not be taking questions at this time. 

I have this bad habit of saying "yes" to things that should actually be "no"s, because I don't have the brainspace or spoons or time. Sometimes I'll even say yes to things that I don't even really want nor need to do it out of pure social obligation. We love a good feminine socialization!! Agree at all costs to whatever the other person's whim is, no matter what!! You're not allowed to make them feel uncomfortable ever!! There are no problems here whatsoever!!

The biggest /s.

It's bonkers!! It drains my time and energy that could be spent on other things, this is basic opportunity cost!!

Now, I love hanging out with my dog. Because she's so great and all. You know, we've been over this. She loves playing fetch, and going on walks, and snuggling, all that good stuff! We have a great time!

So! I invented this thing I'm calling The Meg Metric. Basically, it's a baseline for measuring the opportunity cost of any given *~thing~*. It's a pretty simple prompt:

> Is spending the time that it would take to do *~a thing~* better / more interesting / more beneficial than spending the same time with my dog?

That's it. ~~That's the tweet.~~

It's my own line in the sand to start judging opportunity cost with. It can be helpful in figuring out what I *actually, actively want to do* with my time and energy, rather than complying due to mere social obligations. Maybe you have pets and can apply this to your own life with them in a 1:1 way. Maybe your Meg Metric is based on your kids, or your partner, or a hobby you enjoy. Maybe it's literally spending time to be with yourself. Who knows! You, I'd hope!
