[[Curiosity]]'s [[The Driver]].

[[Being]]'s [[Everything™]].

[[Notice]]

I made up this idea of a [[core curiosity]] to help me design coursework, but it's really rooted in the idea of a [[Thesis]].

I've been playing around a bit with using the idea of using [[The Thing™]] as the imptetus for a given course of knowledge (aka a class). When thinking about wanting to learn, [[Curiosity]], what is the typical student's [[Design]]? What's the core thing they're trying to learn, to acheive?

A core curiosity is basically the driving thread of [[Learning]]. It's the root that asks "Why?". Why are you REALLY asking this particular question, what do you REALLY want to know or get out of the resources you come across as you're searching for information? In more traditional academic terms, it's the thesis.

I find it helpful to frame all sorts of *things* as curiosities and questions generally. The *thing* might be a course, it might be a talk, it might even be as small as the idea contained within a single paragraph, sentence or a [[Atomic Notes, Ideas, Memes]].
