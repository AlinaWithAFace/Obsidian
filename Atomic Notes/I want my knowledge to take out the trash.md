I have suffered from digital hoarding. Sometimes I will just collect ideas just, 'cause. But ideas are useless if you don't interact with and use them. I want my [[knowledge system]] to force me to remove the dead weight and the chaff. Everything contained within it should have *some* sort of purpose. The purpose doesn't have to be huge, I don't have to fix the entire world with a single [[Atomic Notes, Ideas, Memes]]. The purpose is "allowed" to be really really small, like "because I wanted to write something and share it with someone". That's probably the best reason to do much of anything. [[Write for a younger you]].
