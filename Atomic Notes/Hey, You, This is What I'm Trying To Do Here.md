Hi [[You™]].

[[I™]] don't *really* know who [[You™]] are.

But [[I]] want you to [[know]] that [[I™]] *[[Love]]* [[You™]]. 

Not [[you]]-[[you]] of course, but [[I™]] do [[Know]] [[You™]].

[[I™]] [[know]] [[You™]], because [[I™]] [[Created]] [[You™]].

As long as you're [[Paying Attention]], you're giving me a [[Gift]].

[[The Gift is Time]].
[[The Gift is Attention]].
[[The Gift is Energy]].
[[A Gift is A Resource]].

I [[Love]] that you're giving me these [[gift]]s. They're one of the most [[Valuable]] things anyone could ever ask for.

I want to [[Give Back]].

I want to [[Show, not Tell]].

I want to let you inside of my [[Brain]].

I want to, as precisely as I can, show you how [[I Think]].

The thing we're doing right now? This [[Communication Medium]] that is writing? That is the internet?

It's pretty [[busted]].

But it's also [[Powerful]].

It's a [[Resource]].

[[Resource]]s can be [[Harness]]ed.

[[System]]s are *made* from [[Resource]]s.

1. [[I Understand Systems]].
