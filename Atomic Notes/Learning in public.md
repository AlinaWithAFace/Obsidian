I struggle with actually releasing work into the world. I'll sit on it, and mull over it, and tinker with it for ages, and then never actually declare it finished and shareable because of perfectionism. It kind of sucks. So I guess I want to try learning in public, this idea that everything is evolving with me, I'm just a squishy lil guy and these are my squishy lil thoughts and if you bully me I will cry.
