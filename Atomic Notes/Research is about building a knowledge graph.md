A big part of grad school Is just building out this mental graph of knowledge in a given field, reading papers that do xyz thing that are connected to papers that do abc thing
You follow citations of one paper in this graph to other papers in the graph and start to ideally discover some gaps at the edge of human knowledge. Then maybe you hope to fill them with your own work.
Part of the idea of what a thesis might be is just making a lil bump on that graph as you expand the bounds of all of human knowledge (in theory)
