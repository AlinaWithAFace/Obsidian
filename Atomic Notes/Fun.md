What?

Much of [[Game Design]] as a field tends to have an *[[Oh, No]]* [[Moment]] when asked to define [[Fun]]. Personally, in my exploration of [[Fun]] as a concept, I believe I have passed through all of the prerequisite stages of [[Grief]] that are implied after an [[Oh, No]]. However, building things, and especially building things *well* tends to be a bit of a [[Context.]] [[Sink]].
