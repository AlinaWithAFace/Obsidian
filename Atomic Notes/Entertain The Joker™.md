[[The Joker™]] wants to destroy the [[System]] that created him. [[The Joker™]] *especially* wants to destroy [[The People In Power™]], [[Governance, Governing Bodies]] et al, for [[Design]]ing the [[System]] that created him.

[[The Joker™]] has come to *loathe* the [[System]]. 

[[The Joker™]] himself *does not actually **want** to exist*.

Do you think [[The Joker™]] wants [[Society]] to burn?

Do you think [[The Joker™]] is actually *happy*?

The very name of [[The Joker™]] is *oozing* in dramatic [[Irony]], **what in the fuck did you think he's _actually trying to say_**?

**Failing to address [[The Joker™]] is a sign of an unhealthy [[System]].**  
===

If [[The People In Power™]] do not stop [[The Joker™]] from existing there are predictable [[System]]ic consequences.
---

### **[[The Joker™]] WILL burn down your entire goddamned house.**

### **[[The Joker™]] WILL burn down _your entire [[Society]]_.**

### **[[The Joker™]] will _fucking kill [[The People In Power™]]_ for doing this to him because they have given him no other choice.**

**If [[The Joker™]] exists and [[The People In Power™]] had a chance to change the [[system]] that created him, *and they refuse to*, he will kill [[The People In Power™]] or die trying.**
===

If [[The Joker™]] succeeds in killing [[The People In Power™]], he has achieved his purpose.

Look, [[The People In Power™]]

I don't know how else to explain this to you.

I don't know how to be more clear than this.

I'm packing all of my [[Clarity, Brevity, Wit]] into this concept, *just for you*.

I need you to deeply, truly internalize *one thing*:

You have to deal with [[The Joker™]]
===

That's simply *part of the gig* of being in [[Governance, Governing Bodies]].

If that sounds hard and you don't want that sort of responsibility, then [[exit the game]].

Exit your [[Role]], stage left.

Create [[Context.]]s for more voices to be heard who have better [[Ideas]].

Hand off your control of [[Governance, Governing Bodies]] to someone else who *does* want to do [[The work]].

We can make this painless for you. We can make this *fun* for you. We can invent new and interesting [[Role]]s for you to play that are not this stressful. We already have!

We need to get you there safely. We just need [[The Captain]] to take you to [[The Good Place]].

[[Playful Systems Invite Exiting Gracefully]].
