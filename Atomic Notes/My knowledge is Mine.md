Everything in here, at least, particularly everything that I publish, is something that I have written myself. My goal is not to plaigarize anyone by copying their work. It's to publicly synthesize the things that I am thinking about and re-explain them in my own way. If I do use other people's ideas, I aim to explicitly quote them, and ideally link back to their work.

I wrote & own everything in here. For copyright purposes, I own the exact content. Maybe one day I'll make parts of it creative commons or something, and I'd actually perfer that to happen when I die, but that day is not today. [[IP law is a whole thing]].
