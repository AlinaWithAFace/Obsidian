[[Society]] is a [[System]]. [[System]] [[Design]]ers hyperspecialize in creating [[system]]s in order to achieve a desired purpose.

We tend to admire [[System]] [[Design]]ers, and really people who build things in general. Entrepreneurs, Scientiests, [[Game Designer]]ers, [[Art]]ists, Philosophers, are just a few of the creators and creative types that lean into these tendencies. Those who can create [[System]] well make HUGE impacts on their participants.
