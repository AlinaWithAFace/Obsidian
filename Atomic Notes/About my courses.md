The idea behind any given course that I create is to take you on an extended, self-guided journey through the [[digital garden]] of the [[Atomic Notes, Ideas, Memes]] that I have collected and cultivated over my lifetime. They act as signposts, becoming guides for [[The Eternal Student]] through a particular train of thought while chasing a [[Core Curiosity]].

The really excellent thing about them to me is that they are deeply embedded within the rest of my [[Knowledge System]]. Since they're only signposts, working through them independently can turn into a self guided choose-your-own-adventure. If you're so inclined, you can poke your head into other areas of my thoughts on other disparate topics as you browse.

Or don't.

It's your life.

I am merely here to serve as a guide. All I wish to do is present my thoughts to you in easily digestible and coherent chunks. See [[Clarity, Brevity, Wit]].

Eehhhhhhh no. If only. I wish it were that easy. Effective learning requires engaging with ideas actively. Part of this can be reading them and consuming then. Part of this can be writing with and about them, as a way to clarify your thinking to yourself, rearranging it and turning it over intellectually. Part of this might mean embodied exercises around a given topic or idea, as a way to physically explore it in an applied way. Part of this might mean talking about them to other people who have the same context as you.

[[Useful behaviors and information tend to be sticky]]. Part of my goal in creating these courses is to present opportunities for you to *actually use the knowledge and to make it sticky*. In a classroom setting where I'm present, this might mean I fascilitate a discussion, or lead a given activity designed to get you to interact with the ideas. But I don't want to leave students who are independently exploring the information out to dry, so I'll do my best to create exercises with discrete steps that anyone can follow, no matter where they are on their path in building knowledge.

Due to the fact all of my courses are written from the building blocks of [[Atomic Notes, Ideas, Memes]], implementations of them in externalized [[informational products]], like recorded talks, in-person lectures, and semester long classes, can stretch and squeeze to fill whatever time is given to us to work within. 

It's kinda busted!!

I want to be able to take the same frameworks around communicating a core idea and abstract them away from the constraint of time. The only thing time will do to us is determine how much we can cover within it.

When you're on your own and simply browsing my [[digital garden]], you can take all of the time in the world. Unfortunately that's not always possible, but together we can use the tuned intellectual control of individualized paths that [[networked thought]] makes possible to direct the asynchronous conversation we're having, ideally in the most intriguing and relevant ways possible.

I'm also kind of selfish and do a lot of this for me. In my life's quest of reaching extreme heights of intellectual thought around things that I'm interested in, creating coursework is a fabulous [[Forcing Function]] that makes me sit down and step through a topic one piece at a time in an attempt to make it coherent such that another being can successfully consume it.

It's like a debugger, but for my own brain.

Regardless of whether or not I have the time to physically teach these [[Atomic Notes, Ideas, Memes]]and courses, I'll proooobably just keep making them if only for that and that alone. Feel free to use them wherever!! Half of [[Why I Write]] and [[Why I teach]] is to simply spread ideas that I think are interesting in a personal crusade to make the world suck a little less. [[It's Not About The Money, It's about Sending A Message]].

A lot of my courses are centered around the idea of [[Thinking With Games]]. [[Games are playful systems]], and we love them for that!

You're the only person who gets to decide what you want to do with all of these ideas. I can't make that decision for you, nor can anyone else. I'm giving this knowledge to you as a gift and tool.

I truly hope you do something fantastic with it.
