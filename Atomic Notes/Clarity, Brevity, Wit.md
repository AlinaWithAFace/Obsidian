[[Efficient]] [[Communicate]].

A lot of [[Clarity, Brevity, Wit]] when writing is a lot of simply assembling [[Thought]]s in the same way you'd use [[Logic, Philosophy of Systems]].

How can you cut down what you're trying to [[Communicate]] into its rawest form?

How can you discover [[The Truth]]?

I took a Logic for Computer Scientists class in college. It was actually really boring for me, because I felt like I already knew ~80-90% of the content from just learning language and paying attention to how humans talk. [[Latin Atomizes language]].

I spent a lot of time learning [[The Easy Way™]] by just, reading books about how to [[Communicate]], [[Entertain]], and [[Persuede]]. A lot of [[Logic, Philosophy of Systems]] within language is *basically* the same as the things we do with words and [[Communicate]]ion in general.

The key realization that [[Language is Plastic]] clicked really early for me, and I think I've turned into a pretty strong logician & philosopher because of it.

This is just a really long-winded way of saying I'm funny and fun to be around.

You can laugh at any time, I'll still be here :)
