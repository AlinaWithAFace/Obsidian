That sounds like SO MUCH WORK ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
Literally exhausting. I just want to take a nap to be honest.

But it also feels deeply intellectually necessary for me to leave that door open and have it be inviting.
Refusing to step up to the plate when asked is itself a small failure. I don't like to preemptively close doors. I want to be open to a [[call to adventure]], wherever it comes from.
