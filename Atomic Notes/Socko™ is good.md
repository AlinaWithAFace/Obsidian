Required Reading: [[Socko™]].

When [[Socko™]]s say things like "`x` [[System]] is bad and broken!!!", you should believe them, or at the very least [[Entertain]] them. 

[[Socko™]] is just trying to give [[The People In Power™]] a [[Call]].

[[The People In Power™]] have [[blind spots]].
[[The People In Power™]] are a [[Finite Being]]s.

Within [[The People In Power™]]'s [[blind spots]], [[Socko™]]s can almost certainly see or feel something within the [[System]] that [[The People In Power™]] simply cannot.

Perhaps they're exposed to a particular [[Forcing Function]] that just doesn't make any sense to them, given the stated [[Intention]]s of the [[System]].

Perhaps they see the cracks in the [[Axiom]] breaking down around them from their unique position.

If [[The People In Power™]] at all invested in fixing the [[System]] that [[Socko™]]s are trying to warn them about, as an employer, a [[game designer]], anyone in public policy, anyone in public governance, or simply as a "good person", **NOT listening to [[Socko™]] will simply bury the problem**. 

See [[Game Design and Public Policy]].

Burying problems for too long leads to resentment and social dissolution. People stop trusting in your [[System]], *especially* if it has publicly stated [[Intention]]s that are distinct from what the [[Create]] its [[Axiom]] *actually* create. 

Now, that doesn't always mean people are going to immediately know exactly what the problem is, why it's happening, or how to fix it. They also have [[blind spots]] around the system and why is the way that it is, and maybe there's something they're not seeing it in that explains some of their issues. But the human being is still in there, they're still feeling the force of the [[Forcing Function]], they're still deeply embedded within the [[Axiom]] of the system. They're still suffering. The very least that you can do is comfort them in that moment to try and ease the pain.
