> You know Amanda, it always bothered me, you can't see my art, but I'm one of the best artists I know. It's just no one could ever see the beautiful things I made, because you couldn't hang them in a gallery.

You don't have to be a visual artist to be an artist.

You don't have to paint, draw, play an instrument, write a novel, etc.

Coding counts.  

Writing counts.  

Everything counts.  

Yeah, you can't hang it all on walls.  

But you still make art.  

It can be elegant.  

It can be beautiful.
