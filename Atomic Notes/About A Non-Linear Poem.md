This is a funky little number I originally made in [Twine](https://twinery.org/) to play with the idea of a poem that could be traversed like a graph. I started with a single node, added a few more, and it kind of just went from there.

For the uninitiated it's also an interesting training exercise in learning how to traverse [[networked thought]] in my [[Knowledge System]]. I find it's one of the first things that people bring up when they see all of the various links together in [[The Brainspaceâ„¢]], so, if anything, the idea of a non-linear poem appears to be fun for people to play with.
