In order for something to truly be a game, participants must be playing of their own volition. A game isn't fun if there's a metaphorical gun to your head *forcing* you to play it. People who force others into that are generally described as sociopaths, dragging others into their sick games without consent nor concern for their feelings.

The idea of the [[Magic Circle]] has emerged from conversations around this. The [[Magic Circle]] is the space the game takes place within, and demands a certain type of suspended disbelief. You, I assume, would not kill another human being. However, if you've played any amount of video games, you've almost certainly killed dozens if not hundreds of virtual beings. Because of the [[Magic Circle]], you can walk away from the game, and what happens in Vegas can stay in Vegas.

Forced participation in a game can break this fragile sense of suspended disbelief. If you're forced to play a game, for any reason, the illusion is shattered, the [[Magic Circle]] is broken, and now it's no longer a game.
