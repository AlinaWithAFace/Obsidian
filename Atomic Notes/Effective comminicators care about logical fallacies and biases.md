It's important to know about [[Logical Fallacies, Cognitive Biases]] and [[Logical Fallacies, Cognitive Biases]] in communicating generally for a few reasons:
1. To develop self awareness of your open personal gaps present within your thinking so you can confront them before they turn into issues outside of yourself.
2. To take advantage of them should the need arise in order to best communicate whatever it is you're trying to say.

Point one is the logical piece, the self reflective piece, the part that forces you to think a little harder. You should have the willingness to look at yourself and whatever you're saying and get rid of anything that might get in the way of the core idea you're trying to communicate. That might mean ridding yourself and your ideas of things like [in-group bias](https://yourbias.is/in-group-bias) and [strawmen](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman), among others. They are tools to be used to help you think critically about the ideas in your brain, and clarify them to yourself before you go about spewing them all over others.

Point two is where we can get a lil' naughty. Knowing of these biases, as communicators, we can take advantage of these as shortcuts to get particular ideas across more efficiently. That's part of why these kinds of behaviors are basically impossible to stomp out. They are still useful, so people keep using them, so they refuse to die!!

Make your value judgements about how society is bad/broken because of this off the clock, because right now we can use biases and fallacies to support our [[Rhetoric]]. Other people are already doing the same thing in order to persuede **you** of things, and if it's a tool in their box, it should be one in yours too.
