A key insight for me was that companies, including game companies, are really just looking for people with valuable skills to do their work. Choosing and developing a skill set that’s rare and valuable can help you get a lot of places. Creative industries aren’t this magical separate place where economics suddenly doesn’t apply anymore, it applies to games as much as anywhere else. 

So! Pick a skill! Any relevant skill! Master the fuck out of it and demonstrate that mastery! This can manifest in a lot of different ways. Maybe it looks like becoming an amazing 3D artist, maybe it looks like becoming a hemorrhaging edge graphics programmer, maybe it looks like managing a team into creating something great, maybe it looks like developing your own independent board games, who knows! You’re in the position to best know your own strengths and goals, so lean into them.
