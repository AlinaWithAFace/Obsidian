[[Human]]s have Joker Moments™. They reach an [[inflection point]] where *everything* changes. They stop caring. Something inside them snaps. Overwhelmed by the [[Forcing Function]]s surrounding them, they lose faith in the [[System]]s that they're inside of, and pledge to *burn it down*, because nothing else that they have tried in order to get help for the things they're trying to [[Call]] [[The People In Power™]] about has worked.

[[The Joker™]] is a response to a [[Society]] that crushes its most underserved populations.

Jokers are NOT healthy. Jokers are NOT okay. Jokers are malicious and dangerous to the systems that created them. Jokers want nothing more than to see it all just burn. They haven't BEEN okay, for a really long time. But if you're refusing to [[Pay Attention, Listen with Enthusiasm]], if you're not choosing to engage with [[Socko™]], people who would have otherwise been perfectly fine and normal can AND DO turn into [[The Joker™]].

[[System]], like [[Society]], need to address their [[Axiom]] to prevent participants from becoming [[The Joker™]]. Preventing [[The Joker™]] is good for [[Society]].
