I use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlinaWithAFace) for a lot of casual conversation about and around games and game-y topics. I personally don't take it too seriously as a public forum, and try to avoid getting dragged into the more negative pieces of it as a social media platform. At the end of the day, my social media use is about me having a good time, and if I'm not doing that I don't really like using it.

[Calendly](https://calendly.com/alina-christenbury) is my preferred single point of contact for scheduling time. Sometimes it's literally just faster to focus when you're physically talking about a thing, so I like to be pretty generous with my time when it suits me and is financially possible.

I'm also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/in/alinajc), but it mostly serves as a billboard that says "Hi, I am a very smart and visible person, here is my work history, [[Hire me]]". I don't really do a lot of interaction on it outside of DMs because I find other platforms offer a bit more depth, but, it is what it is. It's my preferred point of contact for cold call work solicitations, besides Calendly.

I also run the [Delaware Games Collective discord server](https://discord.gg/BnjbaQkbhj). While I'm not omnipresent, I try to maintain a lovely little community of helpful and learned game-y people, so jump into the conversation!
