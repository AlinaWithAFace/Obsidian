My goal is to teach you valuable information that you can actually use. I want you to learn new skills and how to apply them in new and interesting ways. I want to increase the number of vectors that you can interact with the world through. I want to open up doors for you not only in school but in life more generally. Knowledge is power. People that know how to build things and sell them are overpowered in our knowledge-work centered world, I want to give you a small part of the first half.

I want to empower you to make interesting things that you couldnâ€™t have made otherwise, not just for a job, but for yourself too.
