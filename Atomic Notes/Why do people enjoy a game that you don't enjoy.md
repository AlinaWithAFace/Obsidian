I'm really fascinated by but don't really want to play Elden Ring, or Dark Souls games in general. Sacrilege!! I know!! And boy howdy have I tried, I've picked up DS1 maybe every other year, tried it for an hour, and then walked away because I was just straight up Not Having A Good Time. But! A lot of people really admire it for the same reasons I don't, they enjoy the difficulty, the masochism, the high-brow fantasy theme! I almost wish I could tolerate it enough to figure out why people are so obsessed with DS1's level design in particular, because gamedev circles constantly bring it up as being a masterclass in level design but I also hate the combat so if we're honest there's no way I'm getting into this.
