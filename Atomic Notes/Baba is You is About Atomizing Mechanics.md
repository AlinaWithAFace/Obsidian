Baba is You plays around with the idea of what games can even be by turning the [[Axiom]] into physicalized and manipulable objects, [[Atomic Notes, Ideas, Memes]]s in a sense. Then it just asks you to manipulate them, and tries to lead you to an interesting conclusion within the game's rule systems. That's it, that's the puzzle.

It's *wild* and *beautiful*.

Playing this game is the act of discovering all of the little things that the [[System]] is built to do with every puzzle. You build a repetoir of skills as you go through the puzzles, as they build on top of and with each other. Every step is a small discovery of a quirk within the system. Every level presents you with a set of constraints to solve.

Please god play this game. [Baba is you](https://www.hempuli.com/baba/).
