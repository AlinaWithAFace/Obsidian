[[Create]]ion of [[System]]s.

*Crucially*, unrelated to [[Intention]].

Discoverable.

[[Design]]able.

Given a [[System]]'s [[Design]], predictable things can occur. These are generally known as 'Emergent properties", because while they weren't within the original components of the [[System]], it's built in such a way that causes them to appear.

In [[Design]], there's typically an [[Intention]] to *create* specific emergent properties. 

In [[Playful System]] [[Design]], this means trying to create [[Fun]]!!

Creating [[Fun]] is hard. [[Game design is difficult to teach]].
