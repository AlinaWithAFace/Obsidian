The [[System]] of [[Society]] has a need for [[Role]]s. 

As a shorthand, [[Society]] uses [[sex]]  from [[Biology]] as a way to determine what these [[Role]]s "should be".

We're still playing around with the idea that *[[Role]]s are not fixed*. The "should be" is actually a "can be".

As [[Society]] [[Evolve]]s, the [[Role]]s within it do too. This is generally a good thing, [[Evolution is Desirable]]

In [[Biology]], [[Sex]] has [[Evolve]]d from [[Biology]]'s [[Axiom]].

Expectations around what exactly the "role of [[The Feminine]] is in [[The Society™]] have radically changed over time.

We're going through a really interesting cultural moment right now around the very idea of gender. We're collectively [[Atomizing]] gender, taking [[The Feminine]], [[The Masculine]], and [[Biology]]'s [[Sex]], ripping it apart, and asking what it means. People who are transgender and in the LGBTQ community have been pioneering this stuff for *years*, but there's a really intense uptick in the cultural zeitgeist and conversations around gender, sex, and sexuality.

Which, if you're at all deviating from what "we" consider to be the "societal norms" of gender and sexuality, can be really fucking uncomfortable and even dangerous to your bodily health. People are people, but sometimes we take the *idea* of a mysterious "other" and their identity, and run with that as if it's a great basis for making public policy decisions. It kinda sucks.

Each time this happens, it can be difficult. Sometimes this change happens [[The Easy Way™]], sometimes this change takes [[The Painful Way™]].

This isn't just about non-traditional gender identities either. There are a lot of things about traditional [[The Masculine]] *and* [[The Feminine]] that BOTH suck. Dissecting those is a lifetime of work, but I think it's worth it.

When we use identity, or worse, the *idea* of an identity, the idea of a [[Role]] that we percieve them to be playing, to limit someone else's human experience, we are doing them a disservice.

Consider not doing that.
