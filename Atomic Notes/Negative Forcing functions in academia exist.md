Means "academia bad".

See [[Positive Forcing Functions in academia exist]], [[Sockoâ„¢ is good]].

The only reason I feel safe saying this stuff out loud is because I'm outside of the academic system and don't depend on it to live anymore. Criticizing systems that you're actively in and depend on is really, really hard, and can escalate to being physically dangerous. It's generally not a fun nor easy thing to do, but it's necessary in order to them to improve.

So, now that I'm outside of academia and have nothing too lose, here's my shitlist.

[[Forcing Function]]s in [[Educational Institutions]] that create negative [[Create]]
---
- [[Academis writing encourages niche vocabulary]] preventing [[brevity, clarity, wit]].
- [[Academic institutions encourage academic interaction]] which, when pushed exclusively, encourages [[intellectual isolation]].
- Writing things on [[dead trees]] is a great way to create [[knowledge prisons]], which is purposrtedly not the goal.
- Academic publishing practices where people have to pay for access create [[knowledge prisons]].
- Institutions are generally slow to evolve and don't adapt as quickly as we want and need them to in both good and bad ways.
- [[Doing deep, intellectual labor is incompatible with economic instability]], *especially* regarding [[graduate student salaries]]. 
- A basic cost-benefit analysis from a smart, educated person, quickly drives the most useful people *out* of academic institutions as the utility of credentials they can offer plummets. I know, because I am one, and I did it. A lot of people do this, why do you think there are so many PhD dropouts?
- Barriers to publishing, even [[peer review]], can become a [[Forcing Function]] for self-censorship and pleasing existing schools of thought rather than creating new ones.
