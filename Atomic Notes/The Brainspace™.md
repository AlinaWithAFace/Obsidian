[[Welcome to The Brainspace™]]!

[[Desgined by You]]?

The structure is heavily inspired by [Andy's Working Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org), but I'm more interested in different things so, of course the content's going to be different. If you like meta knowledge-work stuff, see [[Knowledge System]]s.

If you've just gotten here, feel free to read about [[Personality by Design]] and [[What I want]]. I also work for money if you'd like to [[Hire me]].

I suggest starting with [[Game Design]] but you could also start with a [[About A Non-Linear Poem]]. You might also be interested in starting with my [[Course Index]] or [[Thinking with Games, The Dissertation]].

You could also look at the design for [[Erupcio]], a game I've been working on on-and-off and have tried to approach with [[networked thought]] tools.

If you find some of the ideas in here interesting and want to talk about it, [[Contact Me]]. I'm always looking to broaden my horizons and talk to interesting people about interesting things!

If this work has added any value to your life, and you're financially able, I'd love it if you could [[Give Back]].
