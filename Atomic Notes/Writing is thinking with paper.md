You have a big, beautiful brain that has a bajillion thoughts running through it at any given time. They can be really hard to keep track of!! Sometimes there's so many things swirling around in there that things get tangled and messy, or fall out altogether.

The act of writing in any/every capacity is a [[forcing function]] to help you organize your thoughts. In putting pen to paper (or fingers to keyboards and/or touchscreens), you're forced to find the words, arrange them, and organize them in ways that make sense. This can be simply to yourself in acts of journaling, or to others through the vast number of different ways to communicate with words.

In teaching, it can be really useful to have students write essays and blog posts and whatever else comes to mind. It's calling that forcing function and demanding that you actually interact with the material rather than just passively absorb it.
