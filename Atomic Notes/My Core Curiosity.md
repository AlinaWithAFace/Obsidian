Finding [[You™.]]r [[Everything™]] is finding [[You™.]]r meaning, [[You™.]]r [[Reason.]] for [[Being]].

**[[Finding Your Everything™ is an Emergent Behavior]]**

The whole [[Reason.]] this is *such* a **HUGE** question for **SO** many people across literally millenia is because it's a HUGE [[Drive]]r, maybe even *[[The Driver]]*.

Basically I want to smash [[Hedonism]] and [[Utilitarianism]] into [[Practical Hedonism]] in order to [[Find The Fun]] and then *tell you why that matters* by [[Show, not Tell]]ing.

A big part of [[Teaching]] is in the [[Explanation]]. It's [[Creating the Train of Thought]].

This is my attempt at doing so [[Through]] [[System Design]].

[[Learning]] is [[Driven]] *by* [[Clever]] [[System Design]].

[[Learning]] is [[Induceable]].

I want to [[Induce]] [[Learning]] in [[You™.]] [[Systematically]].

## [[To Be Clear]],
### It's not always going to [[Work]].

If you find yourself [[Asking]] [[Why]] [[It's Not Working For Me]], [[I™]] would really [[Love]] it if you *told* me [[Why]].

[[I™]] would [[Love]] it *even more* if you are able to [[Signal]] *exactly* [[Why]].

This is one of the things [[I Love]] about [[Atomic Notes, Ideas, Memes]], particularly in the [[Context.]] of [[The Internet™]]. [[Hyper]][[Link]]s, particularly [[Doing Hyperlinking]], has defined [[The Information Age™]].

I [[Curate]] my points of [[Contact]] by [[Design]].

The [[Current]] [[Implementation]] of that [[System]] is [[My Calendly]].
