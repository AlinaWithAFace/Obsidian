Networked thought! It’s perhaps a revolution in how people think about things, as opposed to hierarchical thought
It’s essentially this idea of building a personal wikipedia for yourself, thinking about and creating connections in your thoughts, which is arguably the whole job of any creative person, finding the new and interesting connections in a given area of expertise (See [[Research is about building a knowledge graph]])

One of the newer movements in this area of metacognition is networked thought
A lot of note taking tools are built on this idea of hierarchy
You have a parent child parent child parent child relationship, it’s all one way
You have these folder within folder within folder metaphors for how you store data on a harddrive but they all have parents that live somewhere
But that’s not exactly how the internet nor human brains work
It’s all, connected
You can use the magic of hyperlinks to directly jump from page to page without traversing a hierarchy
This is how things like Wikipedia get built
You don’t just go to the home page of Wikipedia every time you want to find a page, you bounce around from link to link until it’s 3am and you’ve found yourself engrossed in a page about some oddly terrifying natural event or place

You might call this area metacognition, conceptualizing how people think about things

Networked thought isn’t exactly a new thing but its applications in notes are a relatively new practice
Let alone game design

Metacognition

Tools shape your work as much as you shape your work
