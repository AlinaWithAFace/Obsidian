Sometimes game designers will shit on game theory because its name alone tends to suck all of the air out of the room around thinking intellectually about games. As a discipline, game theory is trying to do and cover very different and high minded ground than game design, particularly around how participants interact within a given system of constraints.

There's still a lot of valuable things to learn from game theory that are relevant to game design. If good games encourage players to make "interesting decisions", you can analyze the games you make with game theory principles. You can take a game and construct the [[decision tree]] that players will encounter while interacting within your game systems. If some decisions within that tree are so obvious as to be entirely moot (See [[Dominant Strategies]]), perhaps your game is not complex enough to be interesting to play. Few interesting decisions can be a good thing at times, particularly when teaching or creating tutorials. But Human brains can only handle so many decisions before they start to sieze up, and their decision making is effectively random. This is usually around
