In [[System]]s, sinks are anything that consumes a given [[Input]]. Once an [[Input]] enters a sink, it is gone, never to return. There is no *known* [[Create]] in the case of a sink.

Think of a Time Sink. A Time Sink is generally anything you spend your hard-earned time on and get nothing out of. They're not great on the surface!! They can appear to be inefficient uses of time!!

But some sinks are actually useful. Sometimes entities and behaviors that *appear* to be sinks are actually sneaky [[Producer]]s, or can [[Evolve]] into them given enough [[Resource]].

Sinks are not [[Efficient]], but they don't necessarily have to be. There are ideally other components within [[System]]s that can account for their lack of efficiency.

It's a gamble! You don't know if something is a sink or not until you learn [[The Hard Way™]]! That can be really fun for [[Curiosities]]!! It's why we have and do science, it's why we have and do [[story]]telling, 

Sinks are [[The Thing™]]!!
