For [[Clarity, Brevity, Wit]], I'm just gonna say the subtext:

Some people are cut on purpose. I learn a from a *lot* of other people's mistakes. I think it makes me a strong [[Learner]].

I am listing people with [[Intention]]. I would like it very much if you gave them [[Attention, Energy]], hence, why some people are cut.

This isn't to say *all* of the cuts are full of [[Malice]]. Please do not [[Feel]] offended if you are not on the list.

This is to say it's also because I'm [[Human]]. I'm simply [[Edit]]ing. My brain is kinda small and stuff falls out of it a lot, that's [[Why I Write]].
