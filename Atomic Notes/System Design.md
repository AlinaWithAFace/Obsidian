The [[Design]] of [[System]]s with [[Intention]] that [[Create]] [[Reward, Value, Utility]].

[[System Design]] as a concept is a relatively new way of approaching and [[Logic, Philosophy of Systems]]-ing about the world. It's an [[Abstract]] view that attempts to integrate lots of [[Component]]s in a [[Context.]], their [[Create]], and break them down into [[Axiom]] that produce a particular [[Positive]] [[Create]].

It's a pretty [[Rare]] thing to intentionally engage with if [[Society]] is [[Transparent, Honest]].

Part of the reason [[Game design is difficult to teach]] is because system design is difficult to teach. [[Games are playful systems]], created with a particular experience in mind.
