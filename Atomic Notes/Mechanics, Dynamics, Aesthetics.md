Also known as MDA. I always immediately think "that's definitely shorthand for a drug of some kind", but it is not. It's basically a design pattern people use to define [[What is a game]] that attempts to segment what a game is into three core pieces.

**Mechanics** are the rulesets, the laws that build up your game world. They define the boundaries we are playing within, the [[Magic Circle]] of the game

**Aesthetics** are the pieces of your game that can be touched and interacted with. This can include basically anything humans can sense or communicate with, which is why communication is *such* a core skill for game designers. See [[Communication for Game Designers]].

**Dynamics** are the things that *emerge* from the interaction between the player and the game. Games can be described as communicative systems, where the game communicates itself to the player through the mechanics, that information goes into the player through the game's aesthetics. The whole of the interaction that comes out of that is the dynamic.
