I get it! You want to make sure you hire competent people to do your work. It's a very reasonable desire. 

Look honey, I have spent the last decade or so building my skillset and proving it in public ways like projects and research. I swear I can write a for loop, and I can prove it, because I've done it.

Look, I'll do it right now, watch:

```python
for i in range(15):  
    if i % 3:  
        print("fizz")  
    if i % 5:  
        print("buzz")
```

Voila! The classic Fizz Buzz! I told you so!!! What, did you not believe me? Do you think I would lie to you??? If you think I'd lie to you why are you thinking about hiring me?? Mutual trust is the basis for a productive working relationship, no? For my part, I can't really say whether or not I trust you, because I haven't the faintest idea of who you happen to be dearest reader. Ah well.

Anyway, that's coding. Relatively easy enough to demonstrate through completed projects within the world and public lines of code written. Now, design knowledge, that's admittedly much harder to gauge. Hell, it's hard to build, there aren't a lot of manuals for this!! I guess my next best attempt at that in lieu of creating a [[Game Design Fizz Buzz]] is some of the coursework I'm designing. I figure synthesizing information such that it can be taught is basically the next best thing to actually doing it directly, and if I can't always show you the things I make directly because NDAs are hell this is the second best thing I can do. Also, bonus, maybe I teach you something whether or not you hire me. Funny how that works eh? See [[Course Index]].

I have spent a pretty big portion of my life and time mastering this stuff, and I know how I work best. Demanding that I do a version of my best work on the spot under an unecessary time & social crunch, and god forbid with a take home exam that I cannot reuse in some capacity, is really disrespectful of that time investment that I've put into mastering this craft.

Not to mention the lack of compensation!! You wouldn't ask for a half a dozen chefs to create a breakfast for you for free as a way to "sample" their work before committing to a purchase! I mean, again, I don't know you, maybe you would, but *I* certainly wouldn't!!

This is the point of things like resumes!! This is the point of things like portfolios!! Workers collect samples and accolades of their own work that they can then shop around with, to show off the best version of themselves to everyone!! Job hunting is already sO miserable for everyone involved, and practices like this only make it harder, not only for candidates because they sink their time into doing non-transferable unpaid labor, but also for you, as people trying to hire, demanding that candidates do all of this extra legwork. We're not even talking about how things like feminine socialization and economic power structures play a role in this context!!

Good candidates, smart candidates, candidates with a lot of options, what do you think they would rather spend their time on? Spending 5 hours on your dinky little homework paper? Or running after the half a million figure they got from google after talking to two people? **If you want to be competitive in the labor market and attract the best candidates to help you do your work, do not make them jump through unnecessary hoops**.

End rant, for now.

Look I'd hate to leave you on that, it's all so negative. I basically just spent the last several paragraphs telling you that the thing you're doing is shit and that probably makes you feel like shit. Maybe you deserve it, maybe you don't. Again, dear reader, I don't actually know you. I am simply making educated guesses.

I want you to do better. I want *us* to do better. Finding out what that will look like is *really hard*, but also *really important*, not just for this moment, but for the tech and games industries at large!

So, I have a few suggestions:

1. Take portfolios early, run code / design tests late. Post examples or link to best practices in your job descriptions to give candidates the resources to build their best selves for not just you, but also in general. Ask for and actually use furnished materials like portfolios and resumes to make your initial pickings, as usual. Once you're a round or two into the interview process *then* feel free to get a bit more in-depth with asking them to perform sample work for you.
2. Compensate candidates for their take home design and/or coding homework. If you want their time, buy it from them, that's the employment agreement you're negotiating, it doesn't just suddenly stop applying when people are in the process of making a move in the job hunting process.

These are based on my experiences being a (relatively) competitive laborer, and as someone who's hired before. Of course, my perspective is limited, maybe there are more things that I'm not considering? [[Tweet at me about it]].
