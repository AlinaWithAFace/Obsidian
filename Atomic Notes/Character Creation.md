Hey, so, I'd like to talk about our lord and savior, Character Creators.

I find them to be quite personal in nature, and a huge part of what I'll sink my time into playing any given game. I love love love unlocking, playing with, and experimenting with cosmetics and base design of all kinds. Once upon a time I spent ~3 hours just decorating my then-boyfriend's hideout in Path of Exile, despite having basically no interest in playing it. I stuck with an MMO for *years*, and a huge part of what kept me sticking around was the fashion aspect of it, as a means of experimentation, self expression, and even to a point the social & trading aspects of it all. Especially nowadays, people tend to chare thier creations on social media, (animal crossing in particular is a fabulous example of this).
