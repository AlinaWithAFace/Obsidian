Game mechanics can communicate ideas within themselves.

We can see this applied in how games with character-specific mechanics characterize the characters they're paired with.

Undertale explores this concept with every enemy it presents. From Nastablook's pitiful tears, and complete lack of attacks in its depressive moments, to all of the dogs in the entire game, every interaction in the game says something about the character preforming it. 

This doesn't stop with enemy encounters in the game, but applies to the player too. If you're a genocidal maniac who literally grinds every single enemy you can find into dust, the game's perception of *you, the player as a character* changes, and the world reflects that change back to you with the different routes it presents.

Civilization as a series is semi-famous for [Ghandi's unintentional aggression](https://screenrant.com/civilization-gandhi-evil-civ-6-glitch-nukes-why/). Once upon a time, a bug in an early Civ game caused the Ghandi AI to act *super agressive*. It's a whole thing, I recommend a read up about it.

Touhou has a few stand-out moments like this too, specifically with one character Cirno. In Touhou 6, she performs this very elaborate attack all over the place, but there's a huge gap if you stand right in front of her. The community labeled her a 馬鹿 (baka / idiot) for this [[Axiom]], and the meme has persisted since. It shows up in fan art, music videos, and even sequels to the original as the creator himself was pulled back into the meme.
