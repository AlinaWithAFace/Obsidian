Game Design is thinking about problems, answering questions, and writing out answers, such that everyone else on your team knows what you're talking about and can actually build the thing in your brain. It's figuring out what the thing in your brain even is before you start to invest other people's money and time into creating it. (See [[Use questions in game design]])

Game designers benefit from advances in knowledge work. We use knowledge work tools like documents to communicate, we use visual communication like sketches, comics, and videos to communicate visual ideas, we make prototypes to get a game feel down before going all in on production. We use wikis to organize large amounts of information in bite-sized chunks that can be edited by a large number of people all at once.


[[Game design is difficult to explain because not many people are exposed to the idea of knowledge work]]
