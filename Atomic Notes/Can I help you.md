"Can I help you?" is a *delicious* [[Forcing Function]] of a phrase.

Sometimes people will have this tendency to dance around what they actually want, typically due to insecurity. They'll ramble on, stand there awkwardly, and waste your time. [[Wasting time is an intellectual sin]], so I love to whip out a strong "Can I help you?" if people are spinning their wheels.

It's also kind of a sneaky yet polite way to get annoying people to fuck off. Asking usually forces the target to think about what they actually want. If it's socially inappropriate to say out loud, they tend to have a quick realization that what they want is rediculous and not cool, feel some amount of shame, and leave you alone to think about their lives.
