How can we explore games, game mechanics, worlds, systems, etc using [[Digital gardening]]? How might Digital Gardening, and networked thought tools more generally, help expand my (and whomever else happens to be listening's) vocabulary and understanding of this medium we happen to have found ourselves creating? How might it help me create my own games with new and interesting mechanics and connections? How can we make game design knowledge more atomic and spread out over multiple projects and people? See [[Game design has a knowledge accretion problem]]

Schopenhauer:
> When we read someone else thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. … Accordingly in reading we are for the most part absolved of the work of thinking. … It stems from this that whoever reads very much and almost the whole day, but in between recovers by thoughtless pastime, gradually loses the ability to think on his own – as someone who always rides forgets in the end how to walk. But such is the case of many scholars: they have read themselves stupid. For constant reading immediately taken up again in every free moment is even more mentally paralysing than constant manual labour, since in the latter we can still muse about our own thoughts. But just as a coiled spring finally loses its elasticity through the sustained pressure of a foreign body, so too the mind through the constant force of other people’s thoughts.
> The prolific letter-writer and Trappist monk Thomas Merton noticed this was happening to him during his college years at Columbia University. Later in life, he wrote: “The true inner self must be drawn up like a jewel from the bottom of the sea, rescued from confusion, from indistinction, from immersion in the common, the nondescript, the trivial, the sordid, the evanescent.”
> Thick desires are like diamonds that have been formed deep beneath the surface, nearer to the core of the Earth. Thick desires are protected from the volatility of changing circumstances in our lives. Thin desires, on the other hand, are highly mimetic, contagious, and often shallow.

Digital gardening is kind of fascinating, I really love the idea of the work, the knowledge, the information being in this evolving state. Personally, I have a bad habit of just sitting on things for too long and not actually putting them into the world for people to play around with.

It's really just perfectionism, I don't exactly recommend it.

But, the idea that everything in a digital garden is maintained, ever-evolving and unfinished, it feels safer in some sense for creative works. Like if anything I make within one is bad, I can just shrug and say "tee-hee! it is bad because it's a WIP! die!" as if the format itself is a shield from criticism.

Other mediums feel a bit less friendly to evolving thought and creative practices.

I'm particularly interested in using digital gardening in the context of game design
