This is a fascinating social phenomenon you can straight up test. People are much more likely to go along with whatever you happen to be saying if you present them with *a reason*, any reason at all.

In Robert Cialdini's The Psychology of Persuasion, they tested this with a copy machine line. Very vogue, very mid 2000's, very 90's I know. You can test this by, say, trying to cut in line. If you say something like "Hi can I cut in line" you're much less likely to get a positive response, but if you say something like "I need to cut in line because I have a friend ahead", they're likely to go along with it. The reason doesn't even need to be "legitimate"! You can just say shit and people will go along with it!!
