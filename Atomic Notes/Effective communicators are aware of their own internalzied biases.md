Not to be all, "check your privilege" or anything, but also, check your privilege.

Think about where you come from, who you are, what specific perspective(s) you have, what identities you carry with you in this life. It's full of all of this depth and detail, and you have a lot of context surrounding you and your life. And that's great! Whatever it is, it's your unique little angle of experience of and on the world, and channeling it can be really valuable to connect with people like you!

But you must also be cognizant of the fact that your perspective is not holistic.

There are approximately seven billion human beings on this planet. Each of them also has their own life, with as much depth and context as yours. Maybe they can see things that you simply cannot and nor will ever be able to see. That's okay, it's going to happen, but it does mean you need to be able to listen to and communicate with people who do not share the exact perspective as you. You need to believe them when they tell you they see problems, especially in places that might be your personal blind spots.

For example, I'm a cisgender able-bodied neurotypical heteroflexible white woman. I have a lot of overlap with The Straight White Male™ archetype, in that I'm white and had a pretty well-off and well-educated upbringing, but I can also see issues around femininity and feminine socialization in a much clearer way because of my perspective that The Straight White Male™ simply cannot. On the other side of this coin, I will never know what it is like to be a person of color. I will never know what it's like to transgender. I don't know what it is like to be disabled in any capacity, nor neurodivergent, but as my flesh prison ages I will likely find out the hard way or die trying.

Literally the *least* that we can do, the absolute floor, is **listen to people who see things differently about their experiences, and believe them** when they say as such. But we can also do better than that. We can choose to pick up their voices when the opportunity presents itself. We can choose to create opportunities for those voices, so they're heard directly. We can create megaphones, and hand them off, and give them the floor to express themselves and create their own impact.

In a way, this is a big part of [[Why I teach]].
