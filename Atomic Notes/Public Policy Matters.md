[[Public policy]] is basically all of the rules we use to structure our society. This primarily includes things like laws and the literal written policies for the public on paper, but it can also informally include social norms and human communication practices.

I'm generally going to use it in a more abstract sense of the phrase. A lot of things in [[The Game of Life]] are more informal and unwritten rules, rather than outright laws directing our legal and governing systems. And that's a good thing! There should be gradients of control and enforcement based on the society of people a given ruleset is designed to govern. [[The Game of Life]] is a *huge* sandbox game, filled with hundreds of thousands of locations, billions of other players, and literally infinite minigames to be discovered and created. Expecting *all* players to abide by the same ruleset at *all* times is perhaps a bit silly because of the sheer number of contexts available.

The letter of the law can be really useful as a common floor for everyone to stand on and for covering edge cases. While the vast majority of our [[The Game of Life]]'s rules are shifting and inconsistent, it does benefit us to have a floor to stand on in order to create a foundation for a well running society. The law can be good sometimes; it's probably a good thing that "murdering other people is bad" is a codified game rule that we're all implicitly or explicity agreeing to play with.
