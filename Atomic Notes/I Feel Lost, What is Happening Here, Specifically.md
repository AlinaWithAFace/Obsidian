Hi there! My name is Alina, I'm really happy you're here! [[I Want to Systematically Prove Why Fun Is The Meaning of Life]].

:D

Just 'cause.

[[Where is Here]]?
---
This is an experiment.

The [[Core Curiosity]] that I'm chasing through this experiment is "How Can We Create Fun Systems?" which is *actually* asking:

*How can we [[Create Fun on Purpose]]?*

That's where I'm pulling the Title of this [[Thesis]] from.

Read about it more if you'd like: [[My Core Curiosity]].

### Everything, *Everything* here is by [[Design]]. 
# This is [[My Everything™]].

[[Why is here]]...?
---

I'm really fascinated by [[non-linear storytelling]], particularly in the context of [[game]]s.

This is my attempt at trying to systematically break down what makes playful systems *really tick*, at the smallest and most core atomic levels possible using non-linear storytelling, which is actually just [[Logic]].

I want to *prove*, *irrefutably* that __fun can be *created on purpose*__. And I want to do it by showing you, *as I tell you*, ideally in a fun way, through non-linear storytelling.

It's *not* traditional!!

But what [[Fun]] is to be found in tradition?

I want to use this website, [[The Brainspace™]] to explore playful systems and playful systems thinking.

I'm just *really* into this stuff.

### [[What else do you want]]?

I want this to be [[Fun]] for you.

I want this to be [[Enticing]] for you.

I want this to be [[Educational]] for you.

I want you to walk away from this a better person.

Maybe if enough people do just that, we can create a better [[Society]].

But [[what if]] it [[does]]n't [[work]]?
---
It's not always going to. 

Sorry.

I'm [[Human]], same as [[You™.]].

I can't see everything.

I will *never* be able to see everything.

But not knowing everything is part of the [[Fun]]!!

[[Ok]], But [[What]] [[Do]] [[I™]] [[Do]] [[With]] [[This]]...?
---
This space is really unique.

It's made out of [Hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink). It might take you some time to interact with it before you [[Learn How To Read]]. If you've done any amount of browsing on the internet, you're likely well versed, but if you're struggling, ask one of [[The Youths™]].

Nearly all of the pages here are [[Atomic Notes, Ideas, Memes]] for singular isolated concepts.

Then, they're [Hyperlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink)ed to each other.

See the thing I just did there? I took a single word, a single concept of the word, and broke it up. That was on purpose! [[Language is Plastic]].

I tend to do this a lot mentally as a way to trace the meaning of words. [Etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology) as a field is really into this stuff, coincicentally, so am I.

I find chasing threads through language to be a *fascinating* and *fun* [[Mechanism]] that [[Drive]]s me, not only in general, but through life itself.

I want this idea, all of these ideas, to do the same for [[You™.]].

What else do you want exactly...?
---
I want to give you threads. I want to give you lifelines. I want you to take them, and I want you to run with them as fast and as far as you want to go.

What if I'm not having [[Fun]]?
---
You can stop at any time. [[Playful Systems Require Exits]]. If you're not having [[Fun]] anymore, please take a break.

I'll be here, as long as I'm willing and able. That's one of the beautiful things about [[Non-Linear Conversation]]! We're having one right now!

What if something makes me uncomfortable?
---
Some of the ideas I'm trying to break down in here might be a bit... touchy. We're basically doing [[Logic, Philosophy of Systems]] in here, which can get really sensitive and heated really quickly. [[Politic]]s are *inevitably* going to come up. Why? Click through out the definitions I'm working with, and maybe you'll find out.

It's all in the words, if you'll only listen to them!

If you've found something in here insightful and interesting, great!

If not, ah well! I tried.

No matter the [[Products]], your [[Attention, Energy]] exactly what I wanted!!

In conclusion...
---
If I have [[You™.]]r [[Attention, Energy]], we're doing it!!

"It" being, doing [[Logic, Philosophy of Systems]] together!!

Yaaaayyyyy!!!

Of course, no conversation, let alone [[Society]] can continue productively if there's only one [[Player]] [[Participating]]! If you feel [[Enthusiasm]] about anything in here, and want to talk about it, feel free to [[Contact Me]], or [[Give Back]].
