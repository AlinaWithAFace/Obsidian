Let’s get one thing straight: I barely know how to teach.

I haven’t done this before, I’ll try to do my best but in order to get better at it I neeeeeeed your feedback. 

If my [[Teachersona]] is annoying or difficult to understand: say something.

If you missed a concept and would like me to elaborate on it a bit: say something.

If I say something and it doesn’t make a lick of sense to you _by god you have to tell me because I was not blessed with the ability to read minds_.

Devastating, I know.

I know sometimes speaking out is uncomfortable or impossible and at times and can put people on the spot, so you can also do this on email or discord or wherever. Maybe we’ll make an easy button, or keep a running chat log during class, I dunno.

There are course evaluations at the end of the semester, it’s more for the department to decide if they like me or not and should keep uh paying me to teach, so you can definitely use that too, but I’m a big fan of quick relevant feedback and keeping anything you have to say localized and timely would be fabulous. 

If you have beef with me on week one, I would like to know *before* the semester ends so I can actually act on it in a timely manner!!
