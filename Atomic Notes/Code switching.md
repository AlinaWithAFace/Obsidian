Code swithcing is something a lot of us are doing all of the time. The way that you talk to your parents compared to your friends can be drastically different. They're different ingroups, and those ingroups have their own internal communication norms and standards, and even if they're not written out, they're still present. These norms might be indecipherable to people in the outgroup, but they're still useful and helpful communication mechanisms you've developed within the ingroup.

Being able to tap into a variety of voices, tones, styles of speaking, writing, and communicating, turns you a bit into a walking Rosetta Stone of varrying demographics. 

I do this at my job as a game designer all of the time. Most of the time I run around like a little goblin, talking with a lot of informal language, making deeply terrible dad jokes, referring to myself as an "actual infant", and using a lot of endearing facial expressions in conversation and over video calls.

This is intentional.

I want my coworkers to get the impression that I am easy to work with, laid back, and safe to be around. I want to come across as someone who's eager to learn and easy to teach, someone who they can explain a lot of the little technical details to and feel that I'll understand it thoroughly. I want to lull them into a false sense of security so they'll feel comfortable sharing their deepest, darkest secrets with me. None of this is actually due to malice, I do genuinely want to help them with their work and want them to help me with my work so together we can do great work, but that's the secret trap that my [[Worksona]] has been cultivated to achieve. It's worked for me so far. It probably won't forever, but that sounds like a future-me problem.

Of course, I do not always do this within the context of work. Sometimes, particularly during presentations or quick, one-off, directed conversations with people who are Time Poor, I adopt a more straightforward and to-the-point energy. I cut the crap and jump right into the problem, because in that moment we have an agenda to get through and people who are Time Poor want to get out of here as quickly as possible.

Hell, I'm doing it right now. Do you think I always communicate like this? To friends? Absolutely not!!! In talking to friends I also act like a goblin!!!

But teaching is a context in which adopting a particular [[Tone]], a particular voice, a particular [[Teachersona]], is super duper beneficial.

I want to command your attention, I want a little bit of classroom theatre, I want to strike a balance between coming across as if I know my shit, while still being interesting enough to listen to such that you actually *want* to pay attention.

I will never entirely know how it's being received since I live in my own body and not yours, but I like to tell myself it's working? Vote now on your phones. 

This isn't a bit, we are voting now. [Here's the poll](https://www.strawpoll.me/46062187).
