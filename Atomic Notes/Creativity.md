Sometimes people wonder aloud within earshot, "Oh, Alina, you have so many ideas!! Where do you come up with all of them??", and the real answer is:

I don't.

I steal them.

I steal them *constantly*.

Nothing is scared, anything not bolted to the ground is free reign, no ideas are allowed to escape my vicious, far-reaching grasp. I will go to great lengths and depths of knowledge to find and steal valuable ideas.

I'm basically Indiana Jones, but instead of weilding a whip, a fedora and a tasteful amount of stubble I have keyboard, an internet connection, and my big ole brain.

Being creative is all about theft. It's taking disparate ideas from literally anywhere and smashing them together in new and interesting ways, and then maybe in the process you make something new. I didn't come up with that many of my [[Atomic Notes, Ideas, Memes]], not really. I wrote them down sure, and synthesized them from my experience and conversations, partially for myself, partially for you, see [[Why I Write]], but I'm pulling from the same zeitgeist as everyone else.

Step zero in creativity is simply paying attention, being observant, taking notes, and processing. It's consuming information and playing with it. It's roling it over in your mind, seeing what makes it really tick.

You cannot create without consuming. It's like asking someone to blow up a balloon without inhaling first. It's just physically not going to happen.

Go read a book or something.
