I don't really like talking about hating things very much, because I don't like giving them energy, but I really, truly hated death note.

Controvertial opinion time baybeee!!!

The main characters are written in the way that dumb people envision smart people to be. People who don't know very much about how intelligence works envision having intelligence as "magic". All of the characters that are supposed to be smart in this universe justify their decisions as "magic", while the facade of their characterization as "intelligent" hides the fact that none of the shit they're saying makes any goddamned sense.

Take this [goddamned potato chip scene](https://youtu.be/XrpdFmb0EMc).

> `Light:` Judging by the number of camera's he's planted, he's planning to make a decision within a short period of time. Any normal person would slip under these circumstances, but it won't be that easy with me L.
> This is the closest you can get!
> *Light opens a bag. The subtle glint of a screen shines amongst the pile of potato chips.*
> I've set things up so that criminals will continue to die over the next three weeks. L is aware by now that Kira can control the times of death of his victims. Therefore, to avoid suspicion, L needs to see the criminals whose names are being broadcast continue to die while I have no access to that information.
> I'm gonna show you, L!
> *Light goes on a writing rampage in the Death Note. Epic music plays, it's quite dramatic.*
> With Ryuk's information and my preparations, I can continue to kill criminals whose names are broadcast on the news, while masquerading as a typical highschool student studying for his entrance exams.
> Just watch me L. I'll solve equations with my right hand, and write names with my left.
> I'll take a potato chip, and eat it!!
> -- Death Note, "Glare", Season 1, Episode 8

I guess a lot of people talk about it. Some people talk about it in admiration, but I think it's trash. It highlights all of my beef with the writing in this goddamned show.

The main characters constantly just *know things* that the audience knows. They don't spend any time figuring things out, making mistakes, or learning. They're just granted knowledge from up on high to work with from out of nowhere.

I don't want to knock "magic" in fiction, I *__LOVE__* magic in fiction. But I think it's better to have the "magic" be within the world and setting as the baseline axioms for a fictional universe's existence than to have it be within characters, *especially* protagonists and characters that we're supposed to relate to. "Magical thinking" is a sign of an unexamined mind in real life, and when it shows up in fictional characters, particularly in worlds that where it actually "works" for them because the world is written to bend to their will, they're immediately unrealistic.

I can excuse this behavior in work that doesn't take itself seriously and is playful. Satire that pokes fun at and plays with these ideas is all fine and dandy. But Death Note takes itself horrifically seriously. There is not a funny nor truly witty bone in this entire goddamned show's body.

A lot of being "smart" and "clever" and showing that smartness and cleverness to others is about showing your work. How did you reach a given conclusion? Can you walk and talk someone else through it, and highlight the specific trail in logic that helped you get there, especially in such a way that they can follow and feel smart alongside you? This kind of thing is why we LOVE Sherlock Holmes as a character, as an idea unto himself.

Death Note does not do this. The characters just "know things" because "they are both intelligent can't you see how they're so intelligent it's because I'm telling you they're intelligent". [[Telling, rather than showing, is an intellectual sin]].
