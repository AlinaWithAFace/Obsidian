I've never been good at holding a poker face. If I'm in a job interview or on a date I'm not having fun at, it tends to be really obvious, so I'd rather save both of us the trouble up front and tell you in advance such that people who approach me for work can self-select a bit better. Saves us both some time eh? This isn't an exhaustive list of course, but it serves as a barometer for whether or not we should work together. Also see [[What I want]].

The Listâ„¢
---
- I'm interested in doing work that actively makes the world better. 
- I'm interested in doing work for other people for money. This disqualifies uncompensated design and coding tests. (See [[Code for me for free please]]).
	- I do a lot of work for myself and the public for free! I can't afford to spend that time on people who won't or can't give me something back! [[Wasting time is an intellectual sin]].
- I'm VERY interested in doing deep, philosophical and / or existential work around games. Maybe that looks like building a game for you, maybe that looks like you throwing money at me to make a game. The options here are kind of limitless. Use your imagination!!!

If that's cool and you're still interested, feel free to [[Contact Me]].
