Part of the reason [[game design]] is notoriously difficult to practice and teach is because it's a vast, hyper-interdisciplinary craft. It touches a little bit of everything in the human experience, and that's quite a lot to go through!!

I dunno about you, but I cannot absorb all of human knowledge!! That is too many things!! [Goddamn it Extra Credits!! Why did you ask me to do that!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQvWMdWhFCc) What undirected and inspecific advice!! It's so hilariously unhelpful that I'm literally rage-writing a course about it now!! See [[Communication for Game Designers]], I hope it helps you more than their video helped me way back when!!

Anyway, the core of [[game design]] is creative problem solving, which is applicable to a lot of different areas in life. Once you know [[Game Design Fundamentals]], you can start to take ideas from anywhere and twist them into anything and everything. This is an undirected cycle, it includes taking ideas from outside of games and bringing them into games, the reverse where you take [[Game Design Fundamentals]] and apply them to other disciplines, and the internal loop of analyzing existing games directly to see what makes them tick. Personally, I like playing with ideas around [[Game Design and Public Policy]], but I imagine a lot of it is applicable to your own areas of interest.
