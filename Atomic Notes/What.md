[[What]]?
---
To ask the question "[[What]]?" is the most basic form of a [[Call]]. It's a [[call]] for [[knowledge]], a [[demand]] for [[answer]]s, and a core component of [[Curiosity]].

Answering the call that [[What]] [[create]]s can be a lot of [[Fun]].

This is part of what makes [[Converastion]] so [[Engaging]].

It's the [[Call]] and [[Responce]]. It's [[The Dance]].

Without a [[Call]], there will never be a [[Responce]].

[[Call and Responce is Culture]].

If [[You™.]] [[Find]] [[Yourself]] [[Asking]] [[What]] about my [[Design]], [[Contact Me]].
