I’m really passionate about making the world better. I want to create fantastic games, create resources for anyone to learn how to create the best games, and by extension, lives, possible. My hope is that making knowledge and my [[Knowledge System]] available to everyone will not only help you on your journey in creating excellent games, but help evolve the art form of games as a whole.

*If any of my work has added something to your life and you feel compelled to support it, I’d really appreciate it.*

The best way to do that directly right now is on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/thinkingwithgames). I’m also available for paid consulting. [[Contact Me]].
