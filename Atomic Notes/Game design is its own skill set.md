Nobody tells you, or at least, no one told me, that [[game design]] is a distinct skill set. It's not programming, it's not drawing, it's not making music and audio. It's highly variable, depending on the project, and can be anything from system design to narrative design to god knows what else. 

Like any skill, you have to practice it to get better at it. See [[Get good at game design on your own by making tabletop games]].
