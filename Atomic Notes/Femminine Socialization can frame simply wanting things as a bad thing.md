As a someone who has been through the gauntlet of [[The Feminine]], sometimes I feel like I need to justify why I want things. Sometimes it feels like I **have** to have a "reason" for it, like every little decision must be audited by the community around me before it's deemed "acceptable". [[Presenting reasons, even simple ones, makes people more likely to go along with you]].

This is a fallacy. You don't actually **have** to have a reason to want something. You can just, want things just because, and that's okay. You can choose to communicate the things that you want because [[No one can read minds]], and sometimes if people are willing or able, they'll help you get it. If you want something, don't be the first person to tell yourself "No". You have to tell yourself "Yes" first, and give yourself permission to go after it.
