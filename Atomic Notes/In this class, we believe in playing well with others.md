Group work is great! I found that I learned best from peers because they were just as close to the material as I was at the time, please god make your group chats and talk to each other outside of class if you have issues, use a discord, use forums, whatever. I can’t promise that I’ll be there at all times because [[Finite beings]], but if you can rely on each other to communicate through each other’s gaps that should just make learning easier for everyone involved.

This is half the benefit of school, you’re in a room with other people who are learning with you at the same time/place/pace.
