Alright, hardened game designer who has almost certainly completed my previous course [[Game Design Fundamentals]]. Presumably, you're here because you're interested in making games with a team. Great!

We're going to jump straight into teaching you how to survive the first circle of hell: other people.

In case you hadn't noticed, humans are, a bit fickle at times. They can get cranky, irritable, and downright mean. But they're also capable of doing amazing things, working together to build greater and greater projects that no single human could even think about creating by themselves! Part of your job as a game designer is to usher teams of humans into doing amazing things of your own design for your game(s).

So! I'm going to try to teach you a bit about how you can start to approach interacting with and communicating to other human beings for the purposes of making great games. We're going to be sneaky little theives, stealing ideas and processes from everywhere that's helpful, from programming and logic, to art and visual communication, to acting and performance.

Are you excited? Good, me too!!
