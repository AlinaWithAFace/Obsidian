Show, don't tell is real.

Telling someone something is one thing. I can tell you things like "I'm honest", "I'm kind", "I'm funny", "I'm generous", "I'm loyal", "I'm pretty", "I'm charismatic", "I'm smart" etc etc etc, but the words alone don't really mean anything. I do genuinely believe I'm like this, but telling you that is kind of useless. It's simply more convincing if I simply show you by doing things that align with these and my other values.

Having an identity is in part a constant ongoing performance art. All the world's a stage, and communicating character is so, so much more than a shortlist of characteristics. It's the action, and all of the other pieces of communication that truly help tell people who you are. See [[Communication for Game Designers]].
