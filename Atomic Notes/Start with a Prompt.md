There's some nugget of an idea that comes from somewhere that you'll start from. You might not keep it, but maybe there's something specific you're going for that acts as an initial jumping off point. Once you have this prompt you can take it and run with it. Sometimes the prompt comes from someone else (whomever happens to be in charge of you in your corporation's hierarchy for example), or sometimes you come up with it yourself.
