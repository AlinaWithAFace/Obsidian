I'm not a good [[Liar™]].

I haven't really put a lot of [[Skill Point]]s into being good at holding a poker face. It's just hard for me. The social [[System]] around lying as a practice sunk into my brain and it sunk in HARD. 

I [[Identify]] as a [[Truther™]].

[[It is what it is]], but it's actually for the best of [[Society]], because [[Truth is Useful]].

This is what that [[System]] is:

- It is difficult to get away with lying if you are known as a [[Liar™]].
- It is easy to get away with lies if you are known as a [[Truther™]].
- If you tell many lies, your [[Reputation]] [[Evolve]]s from [[Truther™]] to [[Liar™]].
- Building [[Trust]] is easier to do if your [[Reputation]] is adjacent to [[Truther™]].
- [[Accumulation in Excess, Greed]] in regards to [[Trust]] enables [[Efficient]] [[Communicate]]ing.
- Lying has diminishing returns.
