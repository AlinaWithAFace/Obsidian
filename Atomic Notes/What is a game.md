Trying to define "games" is a lot like trying to define "art". People will find things to be games in life that other people simply don't, like the stock market, just as people will find things in life that are art that other people don't.

Chris Crawford's definition of a game is a one of the older starting points if you want _something_ as a framework to think about games.

- Anything you entertain yourself with is a **plaything**.
- **Playthings** are divided into two types.
	- Those without goals, **toys**.
	- Those with goals, **challenges**.
	- **Challenges** are further divided into two types.
		- Those with no other active agents, **puzzles**.
		- Those with a second party involved, **conflicts**.
		- **Conflicts** are further divided into two types.
			- Those where the participants don't interact or interfere, **competitions**.
			- Those where the participants do interact or interfere, **games**.

There are many attempts to define what games are that attempt to be academic and all-encompassing.

I prefer a wider, "working" definition that's less constraining.

> But you put 'em together and it's this whole f---ing chemical other thing
