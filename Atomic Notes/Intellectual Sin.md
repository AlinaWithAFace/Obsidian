Oh sins and sinning, what a concept. It's a super old idea if we're honest, basically it boils down to "a bad thing to do".

I like to play with this, and have defined what some sins are to me, intellectually anyway.

I can't exactly make your decisions for you, it's not my job to live your life or anything, but perhaps I can do my best to explain why I find fault within these ideas and practices, and maybe convince you not to do them in the process.

Thou shalt not...
