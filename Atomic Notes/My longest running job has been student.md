I Consider myself a deep thinker. While I've only been working in the "real world" for a few years, I've been doing knowledge work literally for my entire life.

I was homeschooled up until 4th grade, went to high school, went to college, went for a PhD, it's been literally over two straight decades of just learning anything and everything. I'm kind of a tryhard, so naturally I wanted to get good at it, so much so that in high school I took a class about Learning How to Learn.
