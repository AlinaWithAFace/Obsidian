I write to release the internal pressure valve in my brain.  

I have a lot of interests. There are a lot of things and ideas floating in my brain that I want to explore, and a lot of this exploration is done with and through reading and writing. It's [[thinking with paper]]. It helps me clarify what exactly I'm trying to figure out in a very pointed way, it helps me consume other people's experience and synthesize it into my own knowledge, and clarify it to myself in my own way. It helps me phrase, ask, and answer my own questions, or form them eloquently enough to ask them to others.

I write to share ideas.

This is entirely because I don't like repeating myself. If I can create a single write up that I can point to about a particular idea, it saves us both a lot of time. *I will literally get sick of hearing myself tell the same goddamned story to 30 different people, because it's repetitive to me*. It's so exhausting!! I do not like doing it!!

If I can write up an idea ONE TIME in a widely transferable and shareable way, great, amazing, we did it, case closed. If I encounter a genuinely curious person asking a question about an idea "in the wild" I will ctrl+c ctrl+v them to the specific write up, turn off my computer, and go take a nap instead of trying to make the same point again. You can go off and read it whenever and wherever you want, and if you see someone having a similar question in the future, you can do exactly what I did to you: ctrl+c ctrl+v the useful write up of the idea because it's simply efficient. 

This is especially helpful in the context of my work. I really love my craft, and part of my craft means working in teams and being around people who don't really know what I'm *actually* capable of. They cannot read my mind!! It's a fair complaint!!

Colleagues and collaborators don't automatically *know* what I do and do not know, and what I still have yet to learn, unless I tell them somehow. So, I guess writing things down and having them in my back pocket is a nice, prepared way for me to tell, AND SHOW "Hi, I actually already know a LOT about what we're doing right now, I promise. But if you don't believe me, you can read this note I wrote earlier. Can we do our real work now?" The transparency feels useful.

These purposes are beautifully served by Obsidian. See [[If you love obsidian so much why don't you marry it]].
