[[Erupcio Mechanisms, Mechanics Index]]

Players have 1 artifact each, with the image of the artifact on one side and a cross lava token on the other side. They must bury it by playing it as a lava token before the second phase begins. Artifacts that survive until the end of the game are worth points.
