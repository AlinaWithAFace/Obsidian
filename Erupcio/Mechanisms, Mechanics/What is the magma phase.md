[[Erupcio Mechanisms, Mechanics Index]]

The goal is to channel the magma through the volcano while minimizing outlets in order to build up pressure.

On your turn:
1.  Play a land tile, connecting to an existing lava path.
    
2.  Earn pressure tokens based on the leaks your tile leaves behind.
3.  Draw back up to 5 tiles.
