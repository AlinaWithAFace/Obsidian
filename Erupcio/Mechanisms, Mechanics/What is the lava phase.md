[[Erupcio Mechanisms, Mechanics Index]]

Players take turns spending their pressure tokens for lava and walls. They defend their artifacts and try to capture their artifacts

On your turn:
1.  Exchange one pressure token for a number of lava tokens or wall tokens
    
2.  Flow lava by placing the lava tokens on the island tiles. Each tile has a movement cost and a point value. Some tiles have a negative point value
3.  Score victory points!
