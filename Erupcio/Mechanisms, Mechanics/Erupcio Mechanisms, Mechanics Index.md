- # Caption
- It's volcano time!
- # Table of Contents
- # Intro to Theme
- You are a lava spirit.
- # Objective
- Your goal is to build enough pressure to erupt the volcano by collecting pressure points (pp).
- The game takes place in 2 phases.
- The magma phase involves building up pressure by playing tiles and collecting pressure points (pp).
- The lava phase involves spending your pp to flow lava down the mountain.
- Destroying parts of the island earns you victory points.
- Whoever earns the most victory points wins!
- # Components
- Volcano Tiles (x??)
- Victory Point Tokens (x??)
- Pressure Point Tokens (x??)
- # Setup
- Deal 5 volcano tiles to each player.
- Set up your board with the 3 start magma pools on one side of the board, and the volcano on the other (see fig 1)
- You build the middle throughout the magma phase
- # Player Roles
- # Structure
- # On Your Turn
- During your turn, play a volcano card, connecting to an existing lava pool and lining up with the existing tunnels as best you can. 
- As you play volcano tiles, you earn pressure points
- For example, say the board looks like fig A, and you have a card that looks like fig B. Playing it would get you 3 points, 4 for the tile itself, and -1 for the open edge. Contrast with this fig C, which would be worth 4 points, 4 for the card, and -0 since it has no open edges.
- After you play a card, draw back up to 5.
- # Details and Interactions
- When you connect one branch to another for the first time, you also receive a one-time 3 pp bonus. See fig 3. The middle piece would be worth 7 points: 4 for the base card, and +3 for the initial connection to the other starting branch.
- If you are unable to play any of the cards in your hand, put all of them back in the box for the rest of the game and redraw up to 5 from the deck.
- If you run out of cards in the deck, everyone loses.
- You cannot block the start card
- # Game End and Scoring
- The magma phase ends when you have any card with an opening on the 6th level.
- Cap the mountain with the volcano, and begin the lava phase.
- The lava phase begins by flipping over the volcano.
- Players take turns placing their pp on the mountain as lava, destroying everything in its path. 
- The player who has the most pressure points goes first by placing a pressure token on the volcano itself and exchanging it for a number of victory points.
- Each destroyed tile is worth a number of points, refer to the tile victory point calculator for values.
- The most victory points wins!
- Victory points calculator:
- Forests: 3
- Beaches: 3
- Farms: 2
- Villages: 2
- Badlands: 1
- Plains: 1
- Leftover pp:1
