Tiles are worth different amounts and types of pressure tokens depending on how many outlets are remaining after the tile has been placed. Pressure comes in 4 levels: low, medium, high, and extreme. The less magma that escapes, the more pressure is built.

-   A magma tile with three outlets has low pressure
    
-   A tile with two outlets has medium pressure
-   A tile with one outlet has high pressure
-   A tile with zero outlets has extreme pressure
For example, if you were to play the outlined tile here, you would get 1 low pressure token because it left 3 outlets
These would be worth 1 medium pressure token, it left 2 outlets.
This would be worth 1 high pressure token, it left 1 outlet
If you were to play this outlined tile, it would be worth 1 extreme pressure token, since it didn’t leave any outlets!
The only tile to take into account when measuring the pressure is the tile played at that moment in that particular configuration. You gain pressure for that token once it’s played.
