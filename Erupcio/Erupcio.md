Erupt the Volcano!

![erupcio box art](erupcio-box-art.jpg)

In Erupció, the season of games has begun, and local ʻAumākua in tribute to [[Pele]] have taken to the volcanoes to compete against one another in a game of strategy. Win by guiding magma through a volcano to build pressure, before unleashing it with an eruption to capture other players’ artifacts while protecting your own.

*While the game is actually called Erupció, I tend to write it as simply [[Erupcio]] for my own ease of use. Idk the hotkey for the lil o with an accent mark on it!! Copy-pasting it all of the time is a pain!!*
