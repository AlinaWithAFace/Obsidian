> ʻEleʻele resides in the mountain caves, a Moʻoʻalā gecko, surrounded by waterfalls and rainbows in misty sprays, crawling up the sheer cliff sides. The generations they guard tirelessly work the loʻi, kalo fields, ensuring everyone will always have purple poi to eat. Their artifact takes the form of a feathered standard, which when shaken calls fresh rain to fall upon the land - Kāhili Waiwai.
