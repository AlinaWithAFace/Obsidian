> ʻUlaʻula comes from the lehua forests, the bright red feathery flowers matching their own plumage as the ʻiʻiwi honeycreeper bird, hopping from flower to flower to dip their slender curved beak and drink nectar. The generations ʻUlaʻula guards dance noble hula upon volcano-nourished soil. Their artifact takes the form of an eternally burning flame - Ahi Loa.
