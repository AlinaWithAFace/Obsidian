> ʻŌmaʻomaʻo cruises multi-colored coral formations with flashing schools of fish as the Manō reef shark, fins tipped with white or black depending on their mood. The generations they guard harvest delicious limu seaweed, the salty crunch brightening any dish. Their artifact takes the form of a spear which guarantees no harm will come to its bearer - Ihe Mālama.
