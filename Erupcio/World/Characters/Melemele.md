> Melemele lives along windy hillsides, an ʻĪlio dog running through fields of grass as sunshine warms their yellow fur. The generations Melemele guards create the finest tapa cloth from wauke trees, bright swaths of white stretched out in the sun to dry. Their artifact takes the form of the lively and rattling puʻili instrument which calls the wind - ʻOhe Makani.
