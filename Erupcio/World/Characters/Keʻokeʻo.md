> Keʻokeʻo soars high in the skies, the mottled wings of a Pueo owl outstretched as they pass over the snowcapped heights of sacred Mauna Kea. The generations Keʻokeʻo guards are those who keep the connection between the heavens and humans alive. Their artifact takes the form of a gourd drum, which when played can rejuvenate the most tired spirit - Ipu Mana.
