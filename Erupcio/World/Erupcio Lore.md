See [[Erupcio]]

> Once every many years, ʻaumakua gods leave the families they guard to congregate deep in the earth. A friendly wager is made - whomever can oversee the creation of the most impressive landscape and is the first to race down their erupted summit, over the rocks, and to the sea on their hōlua sled - gains the power of the other ʻaumakua’s artifacts for a year. When laughter echoes up from lava tubes for human ears to hear, the bargain has been set, and they part ways to begin the Game.
