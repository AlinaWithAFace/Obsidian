The game takes place in 2 phases:

The magma phase involves collaborating with your fellow ʻAumākua to build a path for the lava from the inside of the volcano to the outside in order to collect pressure tokens.
The lava phase involves competitively spending your pressure tokens to flow lava tokens down the mountain, destroying the island in order to earn victory points.
Whoever earns the most victory points wins!
