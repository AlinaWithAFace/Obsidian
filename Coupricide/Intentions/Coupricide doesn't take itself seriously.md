Shenanigans and silliness

Where does the silly go?
Silly is in the confrontations
how?
players must perform gestures as the characters they are?
if players forget to perform gestures they lose?
players must perform like their characters 
players must perform defeat/victory phrases?
players must bully other players for their political beliefs?
maybe you get caught, and then as you reveal a role to discard during a challenge you say a phrase/act a small part as the character
maybe there's victory phrases and loss phrases for each character
perform on challenges and confrontations?
If you think that another player is bluffing and doesn't actually have the ideology for the action they're attempting, you can Challenge them. For example, if another player attempts Ethnic Genocide, you can challenge them by saying I don't think you're a Nazi.
