    - **Shuffle all the character cards and deal 2 to each player.** Players can always look at their cards but must keep them face down in front of them. Place the remaining cards in the middle of the play area as the Ideology deck.
    - **Give each player 2 coins.** Each player’s money must be kept visible. Place the remaining coins in the middle of the play area as the Treasury.
    - **Give one summary card to each player.** This is for reference only. Players should familiarize themselves with all the actions and characters before starting the game.
    - The person who won the last game starts.
- # Objective
    - **Eliminate the ideologies of all other players, redefining the status quo.**
- # Ideology
    - **Face down cards in front of a player represent which political ideologies they control.** The characters printed on their face down cards represents which characters that player influences and their abilities.
    - **Every time a player loses an influence they have to turn over and reveal one of their face down cards.** Revealed cards remain face up in front of the player visible to everyone and no longer provide influence for the player. Each player always chooses which of their own cards they wish to reveal when they lose and influence.
    - **When a player has lost all their influence they are exiled and out of the game.**
    - Game Play
        - The game is played in turns in clockwise order.

        - **If an action is not challenged or counteracted, the action automatically succeeds.**
        - Challenges are resolved first before any action or counteraction is resolved.
        - **When a player has lost all their influence and both their cards are face up in front of them, they are immediately out of the game.** They leave their cards face up and return all their coins to the treasury.
        - **The game ends when there is only one player left.**

- Brain Dump/Notes
    - Coup but make it silly
    - Where does the silly go?
    - Silly is in the confrontations
    - how?
    - players must perform gestures as the characters they are?
    - if players forget to perform gestures they lose?
    - players must perform like their characters 
    - players must perform defeat/victory phrases?
    - players must bully other players for their political beliefs?
    - maybe you get caught, and then as you reveal a role to discard during a challenge you say a phrase/act a small part as the character
    - maybe there's victory phrases and loss phrases for each character
    - perform on challenges and confrontations?
    - If you think that another player is bluffing and doesn't actually have the ideology for the action they're attempting, you can Challenge them. For example, if another player attempts Ethnic Genocide, you can challenge them by saying I don't think you're a Nazi.
- Game Pillars:
    - Quick Rounds, multiple plays/session
    - Lies, bluffing, uneasy alliances
    - Shenanigans and silliness
    - Basically Coup, BUT with additional Roles
- Rules:
    - There are character roles
    - The roles are hidden
    - You can confront people
        - If you guess their role correctly they lose it
        - if you guess their role incorrectly you lose yours
