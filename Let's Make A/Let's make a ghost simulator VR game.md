VR games are interesting and different than traditional games in that you have pretty much zero control over how the player moves in their space. You can't just stop them from physically moving their body in any way, best you can do is penalize it or make parts inaccessible

Play with this, make them take on the role of an incorporeal being in a world, haunting objects and people in their wake, playing with the world's reaction to a floating lamp

you could take this from a [haunt-the-house angle](https://armorgames.com/play/7195/haunt-the-house) where it's just about scaring people
or maybe go for a story, where you as a ghost follow a loved one / you're following your spouse in life, maybe trying to learn something or learn about how you died

MAYBE THE TWIST IS THAT THEY KILLED YOU, SPOOKY!!
or do both at once, interleaving play and plot, like you know, how games work
