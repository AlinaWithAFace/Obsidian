Thinking about making a game about phone/sm addiction, something where it starts slowly but soon the ,menus themselves antagonize you, you sit and have little to do but open a phone menu and then later it just opens automatically if you've done it enough or it'll get part of the way there, e.g. it's in several steps open browser type address sign in and then at first you do every step and then later it just happens without your input at all and then maybe you have some effect where your health slips away when it's open but it initially appears like your health is going up until you scroll away or put it away
