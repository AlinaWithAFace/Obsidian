Say you're in a world where human aging/death has been effectively solved. Aging isn't a thing, people can essentially live forever, doing the same things they always have
but, just because their bodies are intact, doesn't mean their hearts and minds are. the pseudo-immortals still think the old ways, and this time they quite literally refuse to die
young people still exist, and are still making the inches of progress possible, but the generational power handoff simply never happens, and people are getting angry
so, riots
this definitely isn't a metaphor for politics in 2020 (THE CANDIDATES ARE ALL LITERALLY OVER 60 I'M FUMING)
