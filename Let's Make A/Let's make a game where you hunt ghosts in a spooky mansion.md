# **Spooky Mansion Ghost Hunt**
- # **Overview**‌
- Spooky Mansion Ghost Hunt (working title) is a game for 2-6 players. One player plays as the ghost, and everyone else is an investigator. The ghost plays from a deck of haunt cards in order to spook the investigators, while the investigators search the house in order to exorcise the ghost.
- # **Investigators**
- The investigators' goal is to catch the ghost.
- Investigators have AP, or action points. They can use AP to perform various actions:
- Move
- Unlock / Lock Door
- Discover Item
- Use Item
- Items?
- # **Ghost**
- ‌The ghost's goal is to drain the investigator's sanity. They do this using their haunt deck, which has various abilities:
- Room traps
- Door traps
- Make a board game based on a haunted house/mansion
- Ghost hunting
- 1v4 asymmetrical multiplayer
- The investigators are trying to figure out who the ghost is and what they want/various characteristics about them
- The ghost has a hand of cards/things they can do to effect the game, but they clue in the players as to who they might be
- Ghost’s deck is procedurally generated by combining multiple ghost base decks
	- Each ghost character has their own base set of cards, including 1-2 signature cards that no other ghost characters have access to
	- This is combined with 5 cards from 2 other ghost decks and 3 other cards from 1 other ghost deck, and 7 generic cards that all ghosts have access to
	- 30 cards total, 5 cards/hand
	- If they can play a card, they must
- The ghosts’ cards affect investigators, ex moving them, trapping rooms, moving rooms, lowering player sanity
- Ghost win condition is to mill through their entire deck before the investigators exorcise them
- Investigator’s win condition is to collectively exorcise the ghost, but individually do it their own way, ex psychic might want them to cross over/bring them peace, reporter might want to take a photo for proof, clergyman might want to save their soul, etc
- Players build out the board from a room stack, ala[ betrayal](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10547/betrayal-house-hill)
