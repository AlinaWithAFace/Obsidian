i feel like I never really knew my grandfather on my mom's side
he died a couple years ago from lung cancer
i cried, but only because the rest of my family was crying
nothing really felt different
he always smelled like tobacco smoke
the whole time i knew him, i always saw him as dying
in a way his death felt inevitable
i'd been fed the statistics and anti-smoking ads aimed at children, showing smokers as these decrepit beings, hardly living, holding onto their last thread of life
i think i always saw him that way
always saw him dying
always saw him dead
it's kind of fucked
i named him potts
some grandparents go by grandma and grandpa, or variants of that
but apparently i named him potts when I was really young, and it just stuck
...
anyway make art that about that idea maybe
