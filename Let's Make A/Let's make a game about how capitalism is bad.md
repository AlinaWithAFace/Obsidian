a VR experience about my frustrations with [[Capitalismâ„¢]]
you're watching (or are?) someone surrounded by speech bubbles that simply say "buy" or "sell"
eventually you (or someone you watch?) takes them apart and cut them into "Be"
Alternatively
You're facing a large wall, someone at the top tells you to jump or climb it, but they're holding a rope or are next to a stool, all you can do is hop, if that, if only you had the stool to get up, you're so close
