There are objects of desire that you must fling yourself to
But maybe for some you ultimately just cant

It’s impossible
You can’t have everything you want
Some things don’t respond
It burns
It burns so hard
So hot
you can see others do it
Others have it
But not you
For some reason
Not today
Not like this
<!-- I feel anxious and inferior to Greg lobanov 
it’s like we’ve had very similar paths but he’s actually doing what I want to or wish I could be doing
-->
But I’m not
And that hurts
Instead I’m just sitting here
In my house
Being anxious
Palpable fear
It’s in my throat
Again
The anxiety
It’s often in my throat
