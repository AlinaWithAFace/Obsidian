I find the idea of gurilla gardening pretty interesting, how could you turn it into a game?
just, making seed bombs, throwing them into the world,  bringing back nature and letting it grow where it was impossible to reach before
could be interesting?
I'm almost thinking a sort of 3d isometric pov, with an angry-birds like launch
maybe the different flowers you throw act differently, eg one becomes a platform, one becomes a vine?
