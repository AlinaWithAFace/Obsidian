The Climate Crisis is happening. Well, has been happening, and it's all bad and it's hard to figure out what you can do as an individual to do anything. Sure, you can make little life changes, like biking to work, or going vegan, but putting all of the pressure to deal with the climate on individuals is ineffective at best.
We have to get organized.
Make a game (simulator?) that shows people how to go about getting organized. Guide the player through the process of lobbying, contacting local congresspeople, holding meetings, holding marches, what have you. Base potential actions and their results on real life examples, show what works by trying it.
Potentially play with introducing new economic systems and incentives, ex. what would a carbon tax actually look like, were it to be implemented? How would it change the min-maxing corporations if they suddenly had a real, financial, bottom-line reason to reduce their emissions?
