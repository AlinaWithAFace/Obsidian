people will fill various roles in your life, some will be great mentors, some will be great friends, others will be great lovers, some will be lifelong and some will only be for a little while

these are all valid and different relationships can do many things in life

make a game about it

maybe a puzzle game, something like [gerrymander: rig the election](https://www.gerrymandergame.com/) in that it's a sort of puzzle game, maybe you're rearranging tetris pieces/people into various shapes

the ever-so-pretentious moral of the story is you choose how you get to interact with people and how you fit them into your life, if at all, but also they decide too

wait shit maybe this is just girls like robots oh no

perhaps another metaphore here is to be found in death
people can be like furniture within a room. they populate the space, give it life, give it color, give it comfort

people die.

the ripple of someone dying in your life, it could be compared to the chair suddenly vanishing as you go to sit down on it

your entire life is built upon the premise that the things you have and the people you have are infinite

we act as if they will never die because we are afraid to face death

and then, when it hits us, it hits hard and fast

like a truck to the face

my grandma died in feb 2020

processing it has been an ongoing process

i often find myself tracing thought patterns in which she's still alive

asking questions to "her", generating imagined responses from "her"

tracing the outline of the coffee table and where it used to be

moving to put a cup of tea on it, pick off a book, only for it to hit the carpet and scatter across the floor

the idea of her is still very much in my brain. it didn't just leave when she died. the neural pathways have been set from a lifetime of interaction and play, both with and around her

i move to a chair to sit upon it and it does not catch me

it can't

it's gone
