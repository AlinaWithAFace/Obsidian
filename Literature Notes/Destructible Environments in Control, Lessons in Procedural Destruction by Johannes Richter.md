[Destructible Environments in Control: Lessons in Procedural Destruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kODJsQGXanU)
---
- principle of granularity
	- represent every level of natural detail in every effect you create
	- environment -> objects -> chunks -> debris -> dust
	- static environment
	- breakable objects
	- breakable / interactible props
- procedural approach
- pull materials from models
- finite set of rules
	- eg grass: spawn leaves
	- concrete: break into children
	- concrete: spawn dust
- why procedural?
	- consistent fast turnaround
	- predictable behavior with defined metrics
	- hundreds of assets and variations
	- small team (1-3)
	- scalability
- material driven behavior
- geometry layer
	- unbroken
	- level A coarse breakup, no decals
	- level B detail breakup, edge/detail decals
	- level C higher detail breakup only some shapes
- simulation entities
	- rigid bodies
	- chunks with bonds
	- joints
- RBs initialized at runtime, dynamically breakable
- joints determined by hierarchy
	- internally connected between chunk pieces
	- breaking still allows connections between pieces
- simulation
	- data and hierarchy handling
	- breaking logic
	- particle spawning
	- physx
		- rb simulation
		- constraints
- destruction tool chain
	- prop/environment geometry -> model prep -> auto-destruction tool -> potentially patching physics/metadata -> engine
- in engine it's a hierarchy of nodes
- optimization
	- max 200 rigidbodies on screen at any given time
	- collision delay on big events
		- eg explosion parts hitting each other
	- sleeping rigid bodies with high threshold
		- physx stabilization to get to sleep quicker
		- helps objects stack in game well
- everything is systemic and event driven
	- bullet impacts
	- bond breaking
	- rigid body despawning
- particle sims
	- standard particle sim
	- optional SDF collision
