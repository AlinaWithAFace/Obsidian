- most design docs are uh bad lol
- design docs bring problems up
- There's a lot of bad game design docs out there
	- why?
	- lots of interconnected systems
	- makes them difficult
	- hurts brain to track too many things
	- sometimes things are overdesigned
		- put literally everything in the system
		- "the big book of stupid"
	- bad docs don't embrace iteration
- docs should support iteration and be revisited when the design changes
- build for individuals, build things that are actionable
- "just give me something that's short targeted and up to date"
- "short and accurate easy to find the code bits"
- "I just want a bullet list of things to do"
- create docs for programmers and the people that actually build the thing
- build targeted docs
- ask people what they want from a game design doc
- championing the game is a different angle or reason for the doc
- keep it short
- no one wants to read for years its not worth it lmaoooo
- pretend for a minute you can't code and are just going to hand it off to someone else to build
	- what does that design doc look like?
- cut the useless, cut the obvious
- short docs tend to be simple designs
- all designs should be simple at first
- docs are focused for an audience
- bullets are great lol
	- I KNEW IT
- illustrations!!
- draw pictures!!
- everyone likes pictures
	- especially producers lol
- illustrations are better simple than complex
- don't tell people how to do their jobs with design docs
	- eg, don't get too "real" with any docs, don't do UI design or anything
	- display functionality in illustrations
	- keep it abstract
- same thing with programmers, don't tell people to use eg particular data structures or something
- give people the problem you want them to solve
- create the box for them to work within
- use user stories
	- how would someone interact with the system?
- what's an atomic action?
	- what are the concrete things that that action requires?
- separate code from content
	- tables, appendices
- Kill redundancy, point other docs to owner/parent docs
- avoid might, maybe, if, can
	- it's wishy-washy and invites debate
	- use strong language, it helps sell it and reduces length
	- keep things declarative, "it is like this"
	- What are the goals?
	- What are the boundaries of this design document?
	- What is the acceptable ambition level for this feature?
- make it searchable
	- wikis, desktop search, design bibles
- https://thoughtbot.com/
- automate things! especially if you have data
- design docs are more of a process
- kickoff meeting w/ lead designer
	- why are we building this?
	- what questions does this doc answer?
	- what's the ceiling for this feature?
- knowing the goals from the outset will save you a lot of time and heartache down the road
- know where you're innovating, know where you're matching, know where you're following
- have an approval process
	- helps the design team speak as one voice
- don't write in a vacuum
- mandate talking to other people about the thing you're trying to do
- audit your process
- if your process is oppressive ask why
- it can help to have an executive summary and a lot of images for people who dont have a ton of time to, say, read
- weak language is an invitation for criticism, which is not always a good thing
	- good for discussion, less good for The Law of your docs
