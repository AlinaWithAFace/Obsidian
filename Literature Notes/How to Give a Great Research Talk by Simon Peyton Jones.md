[How to Give a Great Research Talk](https://youtu.be/sT_-owjKIbA)
- Research is communication
- how often have you said "I'm glad i went to that talk"? Use those for inspiration to give better talks
- standards for talks are pretty low, there's not a lot you need to do to be fabulous
- talks are pretty great, you take people's precious time, that's a commodity
- what is the purpose of a talk?
	- it's NOT
		- to impress people
		- to tell people everything you know about the thing
		- to talk technical details
	- it IS
		- give the audience an intuitive feel for your idea
		- to make them foam at the mouth with eagerness to read your work
		- to engage, excite, provoke them
		- to make them glad they spent the time
- the audience you would want is not the audience you have
	- an ideal audience will have
		- read all of your earlier work
		- thoroughly understand all of the relevant things you're working on
		- all about the new things you're working on
		- woke up on the right side of the bed
	- but uh this doesn't happen ever
		- no one knows who you are
		- no one know what you're working on
		- are ready for a nap
- what to put in
	- your motivation
	- the idea
	- that's it there is no 3
- kick off fast or you'll have people drop off/stop caring
- why should i care about you and this talk?
- what's the problem
- why is it a cool problem?
- does this talk do anything interesting or worthwhile?
- be hyper-specific about the one [[key idea]] you're trying to communicate
- everything irrelevant to this idea needs to go
- you can maybe use a video here to help communicate this idea
- make something dynamic, be enthusiastic
- if you as a viewer can't articulate the [[key idea]] of a talk, the speaker has failed
- inject them with a thought germ, that's the joke
- avoid the shallow, chase the technical meat, it's a technical talk, go deep
- maybe do a short overview of the topic, but afterwards the depth should matter, it's okay to not tell them everything
- get technical! that's the joke!
- examples examples examples
- if you have little time, omit general info, keep examples
- examples to
	- show the motivation
	- convey intuition
	- illustrate it happening
	- show extremes
	- highlight shortcomings
- don't get hyper technical, like including figures and formulas, it's a bit too much and might make people feel overwhelmed, there's a balance between the depth and overwhelming people
- getting specific examples after showing a big technical idea can be helpful to give the big generalization some context
- what to leave out
	- explicit outlines
		- no one cares
		- who knows what those terms even mean what we just got here no stop
	- signposts are cool though, good for questions and pacing
	- __READING YOUR SLIDES THIS IS ABSOLUTELY BANNED__
	- overlap is fine, but word for word is fucking awful and everyone knows it
	- honestly reading your talk altogether kind of sucks, it can be pretty hard though but helps a lot
	- related work
		- also awful, no one knows what you're talking about here, and worse it's not about to the thing you're trying to tell them about
		- you need to know what it is though, the knowledge that would be in related work might be referenced in questions and should be in your big ole brain
		- the idea sequence is the part that matters related work wise
- rip your heart out of your chest and show it to people
- this is the thing i care about and why
- when it does come to technical things, just say it's in the paper, yes you bled on it, but the paper is for the details
- Be! Enthusiastic!! Give a damn!!
- move!
- standard fear of speaking things
	- have a script in case of FEAR
	- don't apologize you're in a group
	- humor is ok if you're uh good at it
	- slides are good as backup if you really have frozen
	- silence is in fact okay, pausing is okay
	- beats uhms and ahs
	- face the audience not the screen
	- lazer pointers are mixed blessings
	- identify a __nodder__, speak at that person, psych yourself up using this other human
	- you can almost use them as a baraometer for the group's understanding
- watch for questions as you go
- questions are not a bad thing
- they're pretty great ways to be with your audience
- specifically encourage them, pause for them to make space
- because of this you might need to skip some of the ending bits, this is okay,
- if you get trolls, push it off to a 1-on-1 at the end of the talk
- same thing with hyper-technical things, anything that's too lengthy to really cover or runs your train of thought away
- what if most of your audience is lost?
- depends on the context
- if its a seminar in a small group, stop and whiteboard it perhaps
- building escape routes in the case of people getting lost
- don't make people feel like fools for asking questions
- repeat the questions when you're asked what it is to verify you've got it right from them and let them correct your understanding of the question
- if you have no idea, be honest that you have no idea, say it's neat and prompt them to come to you after the talk
- do a dry run to check for length, slides alone are not a good way to judge length per say
- be a good audience member
- be the guy who asks the questions, be ballsy
- ask questions __early__
- stare into the presenter's eyes and/or soul
- animations are pretty obnoxious, use __sparingly__
- as is individually revealing points
- people stop listening when your time is up, don't waste their time, don't ask for more time, it's hard to say no to people begging for time
