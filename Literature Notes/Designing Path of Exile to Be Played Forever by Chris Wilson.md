content reuse reuse recycle
do A- work, work on what actually matters
they didnt like pipeline releases
devs tend to leave to work on the side thing when the main thing gets hard
planning too far in advance makes you less reactive
don't stall content for later
the game needs to be in its best state at all times
magic the gathering is an apt comparison, there's always something interesting to add, creativity is a well that refills
sometimes there's live ops to do
create content you have no plan for
just make things that you'll use eventually probably
keep your content backlog flowing
there's lots of pieces and bits in the catalogue to work with, a big library of stuff
website access helps gauge community engagement
almost better than just the game
people are retained, they come back

procedural content!!
weapon mods should be meaningful and immediately affect play in a tangible way
