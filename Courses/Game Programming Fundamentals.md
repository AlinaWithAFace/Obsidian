[[Core Curiosity]]
---
What do people need to know to get started with programming, and computer science generally? What do people need to know to begin programming video games?

Prerequisites
---
- How to turn on a computer.
- That's it.

<!-- 
CISC 104

CISC 106 CISC 108 no overlap allowed

CISC 103 is ok
-->

	- [[What's a big O notation]] *maybe too much?* *maybe really easy to illustrate with a framerate difference?*
- Basic [[Unit testing]]
- [[What are design patterns]]
- [[What is object oriented programming]]

Exercises
---
*How can people practice programming and computer science by making video games?*

Let's make recreations of classic games to practice and prove knowledge to ourselves and everyone else!!

- [[Let's make a text adventure game]]
- [[Let's make Pong]]
- [[Let's make Brick breaker]]
- [[Let's un-break a slow game]]

Maybe essays / journaling? Maybe group work / projects?

Misc Notes
---

Programming for games starts by learning programming as its own discipline. 
<!---

In my brain, the core 'stuff' for a simple game is something like:
**intro**: we're gonna make a thing
**basics**: make a block do a thing
**start making game**: make block do things relevant to game
**continuing making game**: add enemies or something idk
**deep in it now**: adding sprites n shit
**really getting into it**: polish-giving things a sense of impact
**more theory based stuff at the end**: save-load, shaders, idk, hard shit
**done**: closing thoughts, shill next course
