Misc Notes
---
- I'd be really interested in turning this course into something like a [Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/c/crashcourse) series. They have a [Games Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTNtlq3-44&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtPTrc_yg73RghJEOdobAplG), but it's kind of more historical / topical and not so much about how to actually make them, save one or two episodes that touch on game design. But I also don't really know Hank nor John, nor anyone directly who runs in thier circles, nor if they'd actually bite were it brought up, so, ðŸ¤·
- Even if you're not interested in or are planning on being a game designer, I do think there's a lot to learn in and around this space about people, psychology, and games. If you're at all interested in playing, critiqueing, streaming, or doing anything in general with games, maybe this course will help you be able to articulate *why* you like particular games, if only for yourself.
