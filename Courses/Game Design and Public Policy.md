[[Core Curiosity]]

What ideas can we take from [[game design]] in order to intentionally design a more enjoyable social order for all players? What can we learn from system design and human computer interaction to make being in the world at large and the systems we create within it a bit more fun?

Outline

- [[Public Policy Matters ]]
- [[bicycles are the greatest form of transportation ever]]
- [[Compulsatory participation breaks the Magic Circle]]
- [[the game of life should be responsive to player input]]

Notes
---
- If you work in or around public policy, government, and legislation, I'd be more than happy to talk about some of these ideas. I really want nothing more than for life to be a bit better for people generally. If I can give people in positions of power ideas that make their jobs and lives easier in service of this goal, great! [[Contact Me]]
