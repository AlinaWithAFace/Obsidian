About this course
---
I want this course to be a [[Charcuterie Board]] of communication tools. You might not use nor need all of them at any given time, but I want you to have the ability to pick and choose which communication tools to use depending on your situation, regardless of the original medium or source. Games are this gorgeous and horrifically multidisciplinary art form, and getting good at making them in teams will require you to know a little about communicating with a *lot* of different people working on a *lot* of different things.

This course is, in part, a response to [So You Want To Be a Game Designer by Extra Credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQvWMdWhFCc). I originally watched it REALLY early on in my game design journey, and like, okay, great, sure, tell me to learn everything, fine. I'm a bit of a nerd, I can run with that.

But can't we narrow it down a little bit? What **exactly** do you mean when you say "learn everything"? Here, we're not limited to the scope of a 7.5 minute YouTube video, so I'd like to take the chance to explore a little bit of *the everything* in little bite-sized digestible pieces. Mostly because it's simply easier for me to work and write in [[Atomic Notes, Ideas, Memes]] than, say, an entire book all at once. Maybe it'll be a book later, who knows, not worried about it right now.

Even if you never plan on working with a team to make a game, you will need to have a solid grasp on communication for one very specific reason:

*To communicate what the game is to your player.*

Players cannot read your mind as a designer. Players cannot see the pieces of your game that are not communicated. Your game might be the best game to have ever been, but if you can't figure out how to communicate what your game is such that a player can play and understand it, it might as well not even exist. If a game maker makes a game in the forest, and no one is around to play it, there isn't really a game at all. [[Marketing your game is important]].

No one wants that!! People *want* to play your games!! *I* want to play your games!! But they cannot play them well if you don't design them in ways that communicate what they are!!

There are a great many ways to communicate with and around games, so, let's just jump into it.

*This is superduper drafty and primarily a spitballed collection of thoughts. I'm still actively working on this stuff as of [[2022-05-28]], so, if you have any thoughts or ideas that you think I should consider, I'd love to have a conversation about it. [[Contact Me]]*
